<p class="stat-block">This belt is worked with images of horses stampeding across a barren, windswept plain. The belt's wearer automatically succeeds at any check to guide with the knees, stay in the saddle, fight with a combat-trained mount, control a mount in battle, or make a fast mount or dismount, as long as the belt's wearer is wearing medium, light, or no armor. Furthermore, the belt grants a +4 competence bonus on all other <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/ride.html#_ride">Ride</a> checks, including ones made while the wearer is in heavy armor. </p>

<p class="stat-block">This belt grants its wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, and the ability to ignore difficult terrain while charging or making an overrun, bull rush, or trample attempt. Furthermore, once per day on command, its wearer can spew a 60-foot cone of poisonous green gas as a breath weapon. Any creature caught in the area of the gas can attempt a DC 18 saving throw to resist its effect, but if the creature fails the saving throw, it is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. At the end of its turn, a creature petrified by this breath weapon can attempt a new save to end the paralysis effect. Treat the enhancement bonus to Strength as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This narrow cloth belt has a silver buckle in the shape of four rings. The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear a <i><a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rings.html#_ring-of-protection">ring of protection</a></i>, <i><a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rings.html#_ring-of-energy-resistance">ring of energy resistance</a></i>, <i><a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rings.html#_ring-of-swimming">ring of swimming</a></i>, and <i><a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rings.html#_ring-of-counterspells">ring of counterspells</a></i>, switching between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a <i><a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rings.html#_ring-of-invisibility">ring of invisibility</a></i> is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a <i><a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rings.html#_ring-of-sustenance">ring of sustenance</a></i>) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period. </p>

<p class="stat-block">This furry brown belt resembles the tail of a monkey. The belt grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. The wearer does not lose his Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing, and does not take a –5 penalty on <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> checks when climbing at half his speed. As a swift action the wearer can command the belt to animate, transforming it into a prehensile tail under the wearer's control. The tail does not grant the wearer any additional attacks or actions per round, nor can it wield weapons, but it can make unarmed attacks and hold or manipulate objects about as well as the wearer's normal limbs (though any activity requiring fingers is beyond the tail's capabilities). The belt can function as a tail for 5 minutes per day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive.</p>
