<p id="agile-breastplate" class="stat-block-title">Agile Breastplate</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 400 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +6</p>
<p class="stat-block">This breastplate is specially crafted in a manner that allows extra maneuverability for some physical activities. The armor check penalty for <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> checks and jump checks is only –1 (masterwork and mithral versions of this armor reduce this penalty as well as the normal penalty). </p>
				
<p id="agile-half-plate" class="stat-block-title">Agile Half-Plate</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 850 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +8</p>
<p class="stat-block">This style of half-plate is specially crafted in a manner that allows extra maneuverability for some physical activities. The armor check penalty for <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/climb.html#_climb">Climb</a> checks and jump checks is only –4 (masterwork and mithral versions of this armor reduce this penalty as well as the normal penalty). In addition, unlike with most heavy armors, the wearer can still run at quadruple speed instead of triple speed. </p>
				
<p id="armor-spikes" class="stat-block-title">Armor Spikes</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> +50 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> —</p>
<p class="stat-block">You can have spikes added to your armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing damage on a successful grapple attack (see "spiked armor" in the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateEquipment/armsAndArmor/weapons.html#_martial-weapons-table">Martial Weapons Table</a>). The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a –4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. (You can't also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.) An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.</p>
				
<p id="armored-coat" class="stat-block-title">Armored Coat</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 50 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +4</p>
<p class="stat-block">This sturdy leather coat is reinforced with metal plates sewn into the lining. An armored coat is more cumbersome than light armor but less effective than most medium armors. The advantage of it is that a person can don it or remove it as a move action (there is no "don hastily" option for an armored coat). If worn over other armor, use the better AC bonus and worse value in all other categories; an armored coat has no effect if worn with heavy armor. The only magic effects that apply are those of armor, clothing, or items worn on top.</p>

<p id="banded-mail" class="stat-block-title">Banded Mail</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 250 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +7</p>
<p class="stat-block">Banded mail is made up of overlapping strips of metal, fastened to a sturdy backing of leather and chain. The size of the metal plates, interconnected metal bands, and layers of underlying armor make it a more significant defense than similar armors, like scale mail or splint mail.</p>
				
<p id="breastplate" class="stat-block-title">Breastplate</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 200 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +6</p>
<p class="stat-block">A breastplate protects a wearer's torso with a single piece of sculpted metal, similar to the core piece of a suit of full plate. Despite its sturdiness, its inflexibility and open back make it inferior to complete suits of metal armor, but still an improvement over most non-metal armors.</p>
				
<p id="buckler" class="stat-block-title">Buckler</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 5 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Shield Bonus</b> +1</p>
<p class="stat-block">This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you lose the buckler's AC bonus until your next turn. You can cast a spell with somatic components using your shield arm, but you lose the buckler's AC bonus until your next turn. You can't make a shield bash with a buckler.</p>
				
<p id="chain-shirt" class="stat-block-title">Chain Shirt</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 100 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +4</p>
<p class="stat-block">Covering the torso, this shirt is made up of thousands of interlocking metal rings.</p>
				
<p id="chainmail" class="stat-block-title">Chainmail</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 150 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +6</p>
<p class="stat-block">Unlike a chain shirt, which covers only the chest, chainmail protects the wearer with a complete mesh of chain links that cover the torso and arms, and extends below the waist. Multiple interconnected pieces offer additional protection over vital areas. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>

<p id="Do-Maru" class="stat-block-title">Do-Maru</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 200 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +5</p>
<p class="stat-block">The lightest of armors typically favored by samurai, do-maru wraps around the wearer's body like a short armored coat. It consists primarily of lamellar and lacks a solid breastplate or sleeves, leaving the shoulders and upper body somewhat exposed, but permitting the wearer greater flexibility than do the majority of heavier armors. </p>

<p id="Four-Mirror" class="stat-block-title">Four-Mirror</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 45 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +6</p>
<p class="stat-block">This armor consists of four plates harnessed together with leather shoulder straps. Two round plates protect your front and back, while two smaller rectangular plates cover the sides of the torso. Four-mirror armor is worn over chainmail to provide added protection, and comes with a spiked helmet with a chainmail hood. </p>

<p id="full-plate" class="stat-block-title">Full Plate</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 1,500 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +9</p>
<p class="stat-block">This metal suit comprises multiple pieces of interconnected and overlaying metal plates, incorporating the benefits of numerous types of lesser armor. A complete suit of full plate (or platemail, as it is often called) includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4 × 100) gold pieces. </p>

<p id="Half-Plate" class="stat-block-title">Half-Plate</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 600 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +8</p>
<p class="stat-block">Half-plate armor combines elements of full plate and chainmail, incorporating several sizable plates of sculpted metal with an underlying mesh of chain links. While this suit protects vital areas with several layers of armor, it is not sculpted to a single individual's frame, reducing its wearer's mobility even more than a suit of full plate. Half-plate armor includes gauntlets and a helm.</p>
				
<p id="haramaki" class="stat-block-title">Haramaki</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 3 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +1</p>
<p class="stat-block">Also called a belly-warmer, a haramaki is a simple silken sash lined with chainmail or articulated metal plates and tied about the stomach to protect it. </p>
				
<p id="heavy-steel-shield" class="stat-block-title">Heavy Steel Shield</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 20 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Shield Bonus</b> +2</p>
<p class="stat-block">You strap a heavy steel shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A heavy steel shield is so heavy that you can't use your shield hand for anything else. Whether wooden or steel, a heavy shield offers the same basic protection and attack benefits, though the two versions respond differently to some spells and effects (such as <i><a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/rustingGrasp.html#_rusting-grasp">rusting grasp</a></i>). A druid can use a heavy wooden shield, but not a heavy steel shield. </p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Shield Bash Attacks</i>: You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield. See "heavy shield" on the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateEquipment/armsAndArmor/weapons.html#_martial-weapons-table">Martial Weapons table</a> for the damage dealt by a shield bash with a heavy shield. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next turn. An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>
				
<p id="heavy-wooden-shield" class="stat-block-title">Heavy Wooden Shield</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 7 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Shield Bonus</b> +2</p>
<p class="stat-block">A heavy wooden shield is essentially the same as a heavy steel shield, except that it responds differently to some spells and effects (such as <i><a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/rustingGrasp.html#_rusting-grasp">rusting grasp</a></i>). A druid can use a heavy wooden shield, but not a heavy steel shield.</p>
		
<p id="hide" class="stat-block-title">Hide </p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 15 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +4</p>
<p class="stat-block">Hide armor is made from the tanned skin of particularly thick-hided beasts, stitched with either multiple overlapping layers of crude leather or exterior pieces of leather stuffed with padding or fur. Damage to the armor is typically repaired by restitching gashes or adding new pieces of hide, giving the most heavily used suits a distinctively patchwork quality.</p>
				
<p id="kikko" class="stat-block-title">Kikko</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 30 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +5</p>
<p class="stat-block">Kikko armor consists of a clever arrangement of hexagonal plates made from iron and sewn to cloth, granting the wearer greater flexibility than that provided by many armors that afford similar defense. The plates may be left exposed or hidden by a layer of cloth.</p>

<p id="klar" class="stat-block-title">Klar</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 12 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Shield Bonus</b> +1</p>
<p class="stat-block">The traditional form of this tribal weapon is a short blade bound to the skull of a large horned lizard, but a skilled smith can craft one entirely out of metal. A traditional klar counts as a light wooden shield with armor spikes; a metal klar counts as a light steel shield with armor spikes.</p>
				
				
<p id="kusari-gusoku" class="stat-block-title">Kusari Gusoku</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 350 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1">Armor Bonus +7</p>
<p class="stat-block">Kusari gusoku is similar to tatami-do armor; however, a katabira—a type of chain jacket—is worn in place of the chest armor. </p>

<p>This light steel shield is specially crafted with a series of straps to allow a character proficient in shields to ready or stow it on her back quickly and easily. If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you may don or put away a quickdraw shield as a swift action combined with a regular move. If you have the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_two-weapon-fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> feat, you can draw a light or one-handed weapon with one hand and a quickdraw shield with the other in the time it would normally take you to draw one weapon.

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> —</p>
<p class="stat-block">This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily. It provides a +10 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. </p>
<p class="stat-block">The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you're wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the armor. </p>

Each suit is crafted for a specific individual and displays the owner's aesthetic. Upon completion, the suit is colored and sealed with a final lacquer finish. The centerpiece of o-yoroi is a cuirass consisting of two parts—a separate reinforcement for the right side called a waidate, and a kikko cuirass. The upper part of the waidate consists of a leather-covered iron plate. The cuirass's leather shoulder straps—called watagami—are likewise armored with metal plates. Affixed to the cuirass are a number of supplementary pieces, including wide lamellar shoulder guards, a kikko sleeve for the shield arm, lacquered iron greaves worn over padded silk leggings, and a groin protector.

<p class="stat-block">Most wealthy countries with standing armies have a different uniform for use in showy noncombat situations such as parades, coronation ceremonies, and so on. The appearance of this armor varies by the country of origin and the branch of the military, but still provides some protection in case the soldier needs to fight while in parade dress. For example, one country's parade armor may be a chain shirt, tabard, leather greaves, and a winged helm. If you're wearing a country's parade armor, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> and <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks to influence a person from that country.

<p class="stat-block">This enhanced form of padded armor has internal layers specifically designed to trap arrows, bolts, darts, shuriken, thrown daggers, and other small ranged piercing weapons. When these kinds of weapons strike you, they tend to become snagged in these layers and fail to harm you. Wearing quilted cloth armor gives you DR 3/— against attacks of this kind.

These splints are of greater size and durability than those that compose a suit of scale mail, improving the protection they afford the wearer, but at the cost of flexibility. A suit of splint mail includes gauntlets.</p>
				
<p id="stoneplate" class="stat-block-title">Stoneplate</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 1,800 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +9</p>
<p class="stat-block">This armor is crafted by dwarven stonesmiths from alchemically strengthened plates of basalt. Stoneplate is heavy and unwieldy, but offers incredible protection to its wearer. It is primarily used by dwarven druids who cannot wear metal armor.</p>
				
<p id="studded-leather" class="stat-block-title">Studded Leather</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 25 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +3</p>
<p class="stat-block">An improved form of leather armor, studded leather armor is covered with dozens of metal protuberances. While these rounded studs offer little defense individually, in the numbers they are arrayed in upon such armor, they help catch lethal edges and channel them away from vital spots. The rigidity caused by the additional metal does, however, result in less mobility than is afforded by a suit of normal leather armor.</p>
				
<p id="Tatami-Do" class="stat-block-title">Tatami-Do</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 1,000 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +7</p>
<p class="stat-block">Worn by samurai as a lighter-weight alternative to o-yoroi, tatami-do is a full-body field armor that combines both metal lamellar and kikko components into a suit of mail with a cloth backing. It typically includes a collapsible kabuto helmet or an armored hood, as well as arm, shoulder, and thigh guards. </p>
				
<p id="tower-shield" class="stat-block-title">Tower Shield</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 30 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Shield Bonus</b> +4</p>
<p class="stat-block">This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as its user. In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. As a standard action, however, you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover until the beginning of your next turn. When using a tower shield in this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for attacks that do not pass through this edge (see cover). The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else. </p>
<p class="stat-block">When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a –2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield's encumbrance.</p>
				
<p id="wooden" class="stat-block-title">Wooden</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 20 gp</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Armor Bonus</b> +3</p>
<p class="stat-block">This suit of leather armor has plates of fire-treated wood sewn over vital areas. Though not as effective as metal armor, it offers better protection than leather alone. Unlike metal armor, the wood is slightly buoyant, and the armor check penalty for swimming in this armor is 0. </p>
