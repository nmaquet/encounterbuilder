<div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div>
<hr/>
<div><h5><b>Death Throes (Su)</b> When a dark creeper is slain, its body combusts in a flash of bright white light,
    leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures within a 10-foot burst must make a DC 13 Fortitude
    <i>save</i> or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Other dark creepers within 10 feet are automatically blinded for at least
    1 round, due to their light blindness. The <i>save</i> is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Poison Use (Ex)</b> Dark
    creepers are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Dark creepers favor a
    foul-smelling black paste distilled from certain deep-underground fungi known as black smear- injury; <i>save</i>
    Fort DC 15; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Str; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>. </h5><h5><b>Rag
    Armor (Ex)</b> A dark creeper's multiple layers of filthy rags function as leather armor when worn by one of their
    kind. </h5><h5><b>See in Darkness (Su)</b> A dark creeper can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that
    created by <i>deeper darkness</i>.</h5></div><br></br>

    <h4><p>

        <p>Dark creepers lurk in the black places deep below the surface of the world, venturing forth at night or into
            neighboring societies when the urge to steal and cause mayhem grows too great to resist. Endless layers of
            filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some to believe that the creature inside
            is smaller still. Usually encountered in groups, dark creepers flee from bright light, but are quite brave
            in the dark. Dark creepers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. Their flesh is pale and moist,
            and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily
            to the fact that they never take off their clothing-instead piling on new layers when the outermost one
            grows too ragged. For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers can cause, this is nothing compared
            to the dangers a tribe led by the taller, even more sinister dark stalkers represents. Dark creepers treat
            their tall, lithe masters almost like gods, presenting them with offerings and obeying their every whim.
            Invariably, several dark stalkers serve as leaders to dark creeper tribes, with all of the tribe's heavy
            work and labor falling on the diminutive shoulders of the creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their own
            decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent imbalance in this arrangement-to a dark
            creeper, a life in the servitude of a dark stalker is a life fulfilled.</p></h4>
