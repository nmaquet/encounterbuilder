Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike. Unarmed strikes do not count as natural weapons (see Combat). The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.   Damage:   A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage.   A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at his discretion.   Source: Core Rulebook "

Benefit: When the mace strikes a creature, holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon's head; creatures subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to the normal effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled.Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, otherwise the holy water leaks out as the weapon moves.Source: Advanced Players Guide"

                    "Fan  Content  This is  fan-created content or a fan  conversion. See here   for more details. This heavy iron arrowhead is sealed with an alchemical  resin; pulling a small string breaks the seal  and activates the reaction in the arrowhead, greatly increasing its  magnetic properties. Action: Pulling the string to break the seal  and activate the reaction in the arrowhead is a  move action. Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls when firing a lodestone arrow at a target wearing a significant amount of metal armor (at least chain mail or a metal shield) or made of metal. The increased magnetism fades 1  round after you activate it, after which time it is a normal arrow.Special: In areas with a lot of magnetic metal, the attack bonus  may drop to 0 or even become a penalty as competing sources steer the  arrow away from your intended target.Drawback: The magnetized arrow only deals half damage.Source Elves of Golarion"

The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow.   For purposes of Weapon Proficiency, Weapon Focus, and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.  Source: Core Rulebook"

                    "Paizo Peripheral  This content  is from material published by Paizo  Publishing, LLC, but is not part of the  Core  Rules. A barbazu beard is an intimidating helm with a full  facemask wrought to look like a snarling barbazu's head.  Extending from  the chin area of the face guard is a razor-sharp blade much like an  actual barbazu's beard, usually 8 inches long but sometimes longer. Description:   A barbazu beard can be used as an off-hand weapon that requires no hands to use; thus, a warrior could combine use of a barbazu beared with a two-handed weapon.Attacking with a barbazu beard provokes an attack of opportunity.  Because it is so close to the wearer's face, using a barbazu beard against creatures harmful to touch (such as fire elementals and acidic oozes) has the same risks as using a natural weapon or unarmed strike against these creatures.

                    "By wrapping your hands and forearms in thin but tough  hemp ropes and then soaking the makeshift gloves in water for weight and  expansion, you can transform your fists into rockhard weapons easily  capable of killing in a fistfight. Description: Each rope gauntlet takes a full minute to wrap and another minute to soak, but once applied can be worn for a day; removing a rope gauntlet takes 1 full round. When wearing rope gauntlets, you are considered armed and your unarmed attacks deal normal damage rather than nonlethal damage. If you are proficient with rope gauntlets, you may use the rough edges of the ropes to deal slashing damage rather than bludgeoning damage. Your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in your hands while wearing rope gauntlets, but the constriction of the weapon at your knuckles gives you a -2 penalty on all precision based tasks involving your hands (such opening locks).Source Adventurer's Armory, Legacy of Fire  Player's Guide"

The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don't threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes). Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.

The wire is placed across a victim's throat and  crossed behind the neck; when the handles are pulled tight, the garrote  strangles him. Description: In order for you to use a garrote, your opponent must be helpless or unaware of you. You must make a grapple check (though you avoid the -4 penalty for not having two hands free) to successfully begin garroting your opponent. Sneak attack damage does not apply to a garrote. Your garroted opponent must make a concentration check (DC 20 + your CMB + level of the spell he's casting) to cast a spell with a verbal component, use a command word item, or use any magic requiring speech. You gain the following additional option when grappling with a garrote. Choke: You cut off your target's air supply so he has to hold his breath (see Suffocation, and the Swim skill for additional information). Any round you do not maintain the choke, your opponent can take a breath and restart when he has to begin making Constitution checks. Weapon Feature(s): chokeSource Adventurer's Armory"

Weapon Feature(s): double, trip The Hooked Hammer: Symbol of  IngenuityThe gnome hooked hammer is a staple of gnome life and the symbol of gnome ingenuity. This specialty weapon originally began as a pair of important mining tools: a pick and a hammer. The gnomes' innate drive to improve things eventually led them to place one tool on either end of the same shaft, halving the storage space required on a tool belt. The hooked hammer became such a standard in gnome culture that when it was adapted to martial use, it never occurred to anyone to separate them again. Instead, a brutal dual-weapon fighting style was perfected on kobolds, one that involves breaking bones and then ripping them out, leaving the enemy in incapacitated agony.

If the attack hits, the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical hits, sneak attack damage, and other precision-based damage only apply to the first bolt.Drawback: Due to its size and weight, you take a -4 penalty on your attack roll if you're proficient with it, or -8 if you're not. Load: Loading one bolt is a standard action; the Rapid Reload feat reduces this to a move action. Crossbow Mastery allows you to reload both bolts as a move action.

If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action). A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you. A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a non-proficient one to do so.Source: Core Rulebook"
