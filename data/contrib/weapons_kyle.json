This specialty weapon originally began as a pair of important mining tools: a pick and a hammer. The gnomes' innate drive to improve things eventually led them to place one tool on either end of the same shaft, halving the storage space required on a tool belt. The hooked hammer became such a standard in gnome culture that when it was adapted to martial use, it never occurred to anyone to separate them again. Instead, a brutal dual-weapon fighting style was perfected on kobolds, one that involves breaking bones and then ripping them out, leaving the enemy in incapacitated agony.</font></p> <p><i>Companion: Gnomes of Golarion.
