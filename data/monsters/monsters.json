Any time a haniver makes a Sleight of Hand check against a creature, it also rearranges its possessions. The next time that creature attempts to produce a weapon or item it finds its possessions misplaced or disarranged, thus requiring a standard action instead of a move action to retrieve a stored item or draw a weapon (unless the haniver has stolen the item in question). After spending this standard action, the character takes mental inventory and is no longer affected by this ability. Occasionally, hanivers replace items they've stolen or leave their old treasures-seashells, old fish, clumps of sand-in containers or clothing they have rooted through. They do this without any added difficultly to their Sleight of Hand checks.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Haniver gremlins haunt the stories of sailors and fishing communities, featuring prominently in parables told to naughty children by disapproving parents. A thousand such tales exist, each a variation on a common theme- the gremlins flap up from the sea, startle nasty fishermen or disobedient youths, and make off with their trinkets.</p><p>Yet as is rarely the case with such tales, nearly every word of these stories-no matter how unlikely or comic- proves near to the truth.</p><p>Strange fey creatures that enjoy skimming whitecaps, flipping horseshoe crabs, and fatalistically teasing dolphins and sharks, hanivers endlessly indulge a mad racial curiosity. Such is their obsession that every haniver must know what is under every rock, in every basket, and beneath every hat. Should they like what they find, they typically attempt to make off with it, clinging to their prize like a beloved heirloom until the next curiosity or shiny treasure catches their attention. Hanivers have no concept of worth, though they know much of desirability, and might hang onto an item they would otherwise discard in moments if another creature-or former owner-expresses desire for it. The gremlins don't steal out of any sense of maliciousness, but merely out of curiosity and selfishness. The most intelligent occasionally even believe that they're trading, leaving behind old \"treasures\"-often strange or natural items that barely fit the description-in place of things they've claimed. Regardless, folklore advises those who have something stolen by a haniver to simply abandon it rather than face the frustration of attempting to rescue it- hence the tendency of fishermen to blame the hanivers whenever something goes missing.</p><p>Hanivers possess flat, leathery bodies with only a few thin bones. Most stand little more than a foot tall and 1-1/2 feet across, and weigh less than 5 pounds.</p><p><b>Ecology</b> <br>Strange beings, even for fey, haniver gremlins bear similarities to both sprites and some breeds of coastal fish. Their fin-like wings grant them great mobility, both above and below the waves, aiding in their odd habit of flitting in and out of rolling waves. Sets of tiny gills and lungs alike allow them to survive in both environments, making them strangely oblivious to the quandaries of those that cannot.

Thus, few hanivers spend more than an hour out of the water. These gremlins rarely keep lairs or places they call theirs, though most favor small flat underwater crevices or gaps in sea cliffs on those rare occasions when they feel like sleeping. Some hanivers keep small troves for their treasures, and such nooks might be numerous and any place a gremlin deems safe.</p><p>Often seeming oblivious to others of their kind, or even avoiding them-fleeing from those who might also take a fancy to objects that fascinate them-hanivers occasionally travel together in small mobs.

Ships at sea, lone fishermen, and even whales and some other forms of large marine life go out of their way to avoid swarms of hanivers. Those that don't risk finding themselves captured amid a storm of inexplicably terrifying, flapping pests, their every possession pilfered by the quick-fingered gremlins.</p><p><b>Treasure</b></br> With no real care for the treasures they collect or interest in items of value, hanivers swipe things based wholly on whether an object strikes their curiosity. Certain objects are guaranteed haniver bait, most specifically any object with a lid or flap or anything that shines. As such, chests, packs, boxes, and tents prove irresistible to these gremlins, as do metal arms and armor, coins, gems, lanterns, fishing lures, buttons, sea shells, and the like-the shinier, the better. Additionally, every haniver has its own favorite treasures, and while one might need to claim every new feather it sees, another might obsess over objects that look like they'd make an entertaining noise when dropped from a height. Such fascinations are never malicious, but occasionally lead hanivers to imperil delicate objects or small creatures. On the other hand, hanivers' fixations can sometime prove their undoing, as these thieves' curiosity about closed spaces make these unsuspecting gremlins notoriously easy to capture, and other curiosities might directly lead to messy ends as they attempt to steal from animals, working machinery, or-most commonly-angry humanoids.</p><p>Hanivers occasionally collect items that prove durable and particularly pleasing.

They once ruled the world with vast empires, and today view most other forms of life as either food or slaves-and sometimes both. They disdain the gods and see themselves as the true masters of creation.</p><p>An aboleth is 25 feet long and weighs 6,500 pounds.</p><p>In the darkest reaches of the sea, aboleths still dwell in grotesque cities built in nauseating and cyclopean styles.</p><p>There they are served by countless slaves culled from every nation, air-breathing and aquatic alike, although the air-breathing slaves are doubly bound by magic and the need to constantly replenish their water-breathing ability via the excretions of their aboleth masters.

They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are s<i>aid</i> to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar's hand. Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter. In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be. Though they are not gods, the solars' power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities-never without the deity's approval-or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities (which they may be, depending on the deity). Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been \"promoted\" to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods' first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or <i>destruction</i> of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil. Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of halfcelestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals' proximity to celestial energy.

The archons can remain in this form for 2d4 rounds. When the gestalt separates back into individual lantern archons, its remaining hit points are divided evenly among them; if it had less than 9 hit points, some of the component archons die when the gestalt ends. </h5><h5><b>Light Ray (Ex)</b> A lantern archon can fire beams of light to damage foes. These light rays have a maximum range of 30 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Friendly and curious beings, lantern archons eagerly converse with and assist other creatures. Their bodies, however, are merely globes of spiritual purity and pale light, and though they might interact with their surroundings through pure force of will, such interaction proves too weak to help with most physical tasks. Their evasive natures make them exceptional at scouting-at least in areas where strange lights aren't unusual-relaying messages, and overwhelming enemies with surprise and group tactics. Although they appear fragile, their forms guard them against all but the most profane attacks. A lantern archon always glows, usually as bright as a torch. They have total control over the color of light they shed, and take great pleasure in modulating their colors and brightness in time to music or to entertain other creatures. Most lantern archons speak in airy, echoing voices, with tones that range from somber whispers to hurried chirping. Often, their light fluctuates along with their words or tones, punctuating their speech with sparks of light or gentle pulses. As a swift action, a lantern archon can dampen its light to that of a candle for 1 round. Only death can extinguish this light. As lantern archons never sleep or eat, they make excellent watchers and guardians. Lantern archons light many settlements in the celestial realms in lieu of mundane or magical illumination, serving as disguised sentinels always watchful for approaching evil. Small but fast and zealous, lantern archons make excellent support troops in celestial armies, swarming over weak opponents or teleporting en masse to flanking positions to cut off reinforcements or escape routes. These miniature archons work well together and know that there is great strength in numbers, uniting in times of need and desperation to form gestalts with greater control over their surroundings. Especially brave lantern archons might eventually be promoted into a more powerful kind of archon, but most are content with their status.</p></h4></div>","Gear":"","OtherGear":"","CharacterFlag":"0","CompanionFlag":"0","Fly":"0","Climb":"0","Burrow":"0","Swim":"0","Land":"0","TemplatesApplied":"","AgeCategory":"adult","DontUseRacialHD":"0","VariantParent":"","ClassArchetypes":"","CompanionFamiliarLink":"NULL","AlternateNameForm":"","UniqueMonster":"0","MR":"0","Mythic":"0","MT":"0","Description":"<p></p><p>Friendly and curious beings, lantern archons eagerly converse with and assist other creatures.

Although they appear fragile, their forms guard them against all but the most profane attacks. A lantern archon always glows, usually as bright as a torch. They have total control over the color of light they shed, and take great pleasure in modulating their colors and brightness in time to music or to entertain other creatures. Most lantern archons speak in airy, echoing voices, with tones that range from somber whispers to hurried chirping. Often, their light fluctuates along with their words or tones, punctuating their speech with sparks of light or gentle pulses. As a swift action, a lantern archon can dampen its light to that of a candle for 1 round. Only death can extinguish this light. As lantern archons never sleep or eat, they make excellent watchers and guardians. Lantern archons light many settlements in the celestial realms in lieu of mundane or magical illumination, serving as disguised sentinels always watchful for approaching evil. Small but fast and zealous, lantern archons make excellent support troops in celestial armies, swarming over weak opponents or teleporting en masse to flanking positions to cut off reinforcements or escape routes. These miniature archons work well together and know that there is great strength in numbers, uniting in times of need and desperation to form gestalts with greater control over their surroundings. Especially brave lantern archons might eventually be promoted into a more powerful kind of archon, but most are content with their status.</p>","Description_Visual":"Shedding a warm and calming radiance, this orb of light moves with a preternatural silence and otherworldly grace.","Init":"+4","Senses":"darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +4","SR":"","DR":"10/evil","Immune":"electricity, petrification","Weaknesses":"","SpecialAttacks":"","SpellLikeAbilities":"<b>Spell-Like Abilities</b> (CL 3rd):<br>At Will&mdash;<i><i>aid</i></i>,<i> <i>continual flame</i></i>,<i> <i>detect evil</i></i>, <i><i>greater teleport</i></i> (self plus 50 lbs. of objects only)"},{"Name":"Trumpet Archon","CR":"14","XP":"38400","Race":"","Class":"","MonsterSource":"","Alignment":"LG","Size":"Medium","Type":"outsider","SubType":"(archon, extraplanar, good, lawful)","AC":"27, touch 13, flat-footed 24","HP":"175","HD":"(14d10+98)","Saves":"Fort +16, Ref +9, Will +14; +4 vs. poison, +2 resistance vs. evil","Fort":"16","Ref":"9","Will":"14","Speed":"40 ft., fly 90 ft.

A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long; smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild blackberries.

This catastrophic withering begins on the round the creature is bitten and continues for another 4 rounds thereafter, for 5 rounds of withering in all. Each round the rot persists, the target must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution damage.

If a black pudding remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 21 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.</h5><h5><b> Corrosion (Ex)</b> An opponent that is being constricted by a black pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.</h5><h5><b> Split (Ex)</b> Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a black pudding. Instead, the creature splits into two identical puddings, each with half of the original's current hit points (round down). A pudding with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.</h5><h5><b> Suction (Ex)</b> The black pudding can create powerful suction against any surface as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A black pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a black pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Black puddings are the scavengers of the underworld, constantly on the lookout for a meal.

Typically found on the fringes of civilization, these stoic people vary widely in appearance, their skin tones typically appearing deeply tanned but similar to the humans who occupy nearby regions, while their lower bodies borrow the colorations of local equines. Centaur hair and eyes trend toward darker colors and their features tend to be broad, while the overall bulk of their bodies is inf luenced by the size of the horses their lower quarters resemble.

It can still use its whip-like tail to strike at other targets. Attacks that hit an engulfing cloaker deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. </h5><h5><b>Moan (Ex)</b> A cloaker can emit an infrasonic moan as a standard action, with one of four effects. <i>Fear:</i> All creatures in a 30-foot spread must save (Will negates) or become panicked for 2 rounds. <i>Nausea:</i> All creatures in a 30-foot cone must save (Fortitude negates) or fall prone and be nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. <i>Stupor:</i> A single creature within 30 feet is affected by <i>hold monster</i> for 5 rounds (Will negates). <i>Unnerve:</i> Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those in the area for more than 6 consecutive rounds must save (Will negates) or enter a trance, helpless until the moaning stops. Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mind-affecting attacks. A creature that successfully saves against the cloaker's fear, nausea, or unnerve moans cannot be affected by that same moan effect from that cloaker for 24 hours. All of the save DCs against a cloaker's moan are DC 15. Save DCs are Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Shadow Shift (Su)</b> When in dim illumination, a cloaker can manipulate shadows as a free action to create one of three effects: <i>blur</i> (lasts 1d4 rounds, self only), <i>mirror image</i> (CL 6th), or <i>silent image</i> (DC 15, CL 6th, save DC is Charisma-based).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Resembling hideously evil flying manta rays, cloakers are mysterious and paranoid creatures.

(This slow petrification does not alter a bitten creature's natural armor.) A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by a cockatrice's bites immediately turns completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day, a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save to recover from the petrification, at which point the victim returns to flesh with 1 Dexterity (and thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal)-but after a petrified creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has its Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources. A cockatrice is immune to the petrification ability of itself and of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally.

The darkmantle isn't a particularly good climber, but it can cling to a cave roof like a bat, hanging by the hooks at the ends of its tentacles so that its dangling body looks nearly indistinguishable from a stalactite. In this hidden position, the darkmantle waits for prey to pass beneath, at which point it drops and swoops down to attack its victim, slamming its body against the foe and attempting to wrap its webbed tentacles around the target. If the darkmantle misses its prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its prey is vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously injured (in which case the creature flutters back up to the roof to hide and hope its \"prey\" leaves it alone). The darkmantle's inborn ability to cloak the area around it in magical <i>darkness</i> gives it an additional advantage over foes that rely upon light to see.

If the balor wins the check, it draws the foe into an adjacent square. The foe gains the grappled condition, but the balor does not. </h5><h5><b>Flaming Body (Su)</b> A balor's body is covered in dancing flames.

A creature that grapples a balor or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists. </h5><h5><b>Vorpal Strike (Su)</b> Any slashing weapon a balor wields (including its standard longsword and whip) gains the vorpal weapon quality.

It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, caster level checks, and skill checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 10 for each growth point, and its caster level for spell-like abilities increases by 1. For every 2 growth points, its natural armor bonus, SR, and CR increase by 1. Every time it gains a growth point it makes a DC 30 caster level check-success indicates it matures (gaining both the advanced and the giant simple templates) and <i>plane shifts</i> to the Abyss in a burst of smoke. A nabasu can have a maximum of 20 growth points-it automatically matures if it has not done so already when it reaches 20 growth points. </h5><h5><b>Death-Stealing Gaze (Su)</b> As a free action once per day per growth point (minimum of 1/day), a nabasu can activate its deathstealing gaze for a full round. All living creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner immediately transforms into a ghoul under the nabasu's control. A nabasu's gaze can only create one ghoul per round-if multiple humans perish from the gaze in a round, the nabasu picks which human becomes a ghoul.

What spark of instinct or memory lingers on within a lemure's semi-consciousness regularly shapes its features to mimic those of its tormentors or the tortured souls around it. Grotesque and useless, a lemure's features speak nothing of what it once was. Many exhibit multiple terrible visages or are nothing more than churning pillars of cancerous flesh. Only their knobby, flailing limbs work as they should, and those they merely use to destroy any non-infernal life that draws too near. Moving lemures typically congeal in forms over 4 feet tall and weigh upward of 200 pounds, though when at rest these disgusting fiends often appear to be little more than lumps of melted flesh and malformed features.</p><p>Although among the most loathsome creatures in existence, lemures serve a vital role in Hell's perverse ecology. When at the end of a mortal life a creature's soul is damned-whether because it revered diabolical forces or failed in the worship of another deity-it joins the masses of suffering souls filling the plains of Avernus, Hell's first layer.

What spark of instinct or memory lingers on within a lemure's semi-consciousness regularly shapes its features to mimic those of its tormentors or the tortured souls around it. Grotesque and useless, a lemure's features speak nothing of what it once was. Many exhibit multiple terrible visages or are nothing more than churning pillars of cancerous flesh. Only their knobby, flailing limbs work as they should, and those they merely use to destroy any non-infernal life that draws too near. Moving lemures typically congeal in forms over 4 feet tall and weigh upward of 200 pounds, though when at rest these disgusting fiends often appear to be little more than lumps of melted flesh and malformed features.</p><p>Although among the most loathsome creatures in existence, lemures serve a vital role in Hell's perverse ecology.

A pit fiend can transform one lemure for every Hit Die the pit fiend possesses. It can then reshape these lemures into a number of Hit Dice's worth of lesser devils (see page 71) equal to the number of lemures affected. For example, a typical 20 Hit Dice pit fiend could transform 20 lemures into two bone devils (10 HD each), or three bearded devils (6 HD each, leaving two lemures unchanged), or any other combination of lesser devils. Lemures to be reshaped must be within 50 feet of the pit fiend, becoming stationary and unable to move once the shaping begins. After a minute passes, the lemures reform into the shape of a new lesser devil ready to follow the orders of the pit fiend. Although pit fiends can, technically, elevate a mass of 20 lemures into a new pit fiend, most are hesitant to do so since they have no special control over a devil created in this manner. </h5><h5><b>Disease (Su)</b> Devil Chills: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 32; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.

A DC 22 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the devourer's chest. The creature cannot be brought back to life until the devourer's destruction (or a spell deflection-see below) releases its soul. A devourer can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides a devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer must expend essence points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell's level (for sake of ease, spell levels for its spell-like abilities are included in its stats to the left in superscript). At the start of an encounter, a devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. The trapped essence gains one permanent negative level for every 5 points of essence drained-these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish.</i> The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Spell Deflection (Su)</b> If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they instead affect a devoured soul: <i>banishment</i>, <i>chaos hammer</i>, <i>confusion</i>, <i>crushing despair</i>, <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>dispel evil</i>, <i>dominate person</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>holy word</i>, <i>hypnotism</i>, <i>imprisonment</i>, <i>magic jar</i>, <i>maze</i>, <i>suggestion</i>, <i>trap the soul</i>, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected-success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Devourers are the undead remnants of fiends and evil spellcasters who became lost beyond the farthest reaches of the multiverse.

This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per age category of the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon's breath weapon (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the total damage dice of the pool is halved until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface. </h5><h5><b>Acidic Bite (Su)</b> At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6.</h5><h5><b> Charm Reptiles (Sp)</b> A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a mass charm monster spell that affects only reptilian animals. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.</h5><h5><b> Corrupt Water (Sp)</b> Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence.</h5><h5><b> Speak with Reptiles (Sp)</b> A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals.</h5><h5><b> Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</b> A black dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile-darkness (radius 10 feet per age category); Old-plant growth; Ancient-insect plague.</h5><h5><b> Swamp Stride (Ex)</b> A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. Hissing green acid drips from the fanged maw of this blackscaled, horned dragon.</h5><h5><b> Water Breathing (Ex)</b> A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged. <table> <tr><th>Age Category</th><th>Special Abilities</th><th>Caster Level</th></tr> <tr><td>Wyrmling</td><td>Immunity to acid, water breathing</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Very young</td><td>Swamp stride</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Young</td><td>Speak with reptiles</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Juvenile</td><td>Darkness</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Young adult</td><td>DR 5/magic, spell resistance</td><td>1st</td></tr> <tr><td>Adult</td><td>Corrupt water, frightful presence</td><td>3rd</td></tr> <tr><td>Mature adult</td><td>DR 10/magic</td><td>5th</td></tr> <tr><td>Old</td><td>Acidic bite, plant growth</td><td>7th</td></tr> <tr><td>Very old</td><td>DR 15/magic</td><td>9th</td></tr> <tr><td>Ancient</td><td>Acid pool, insect plague</td><td>11th</td></tr> <tr><td>Wyrm</td><td>DR 20/magic</td><td>13th</td></tr> <tr><td>Great wyrm</td><td>Charm reptiles</td><td>15th</td></tr> </table> </h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation.

This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per age category of the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon's breath weapon (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the total damage dice of the pool is halved until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface. </h5><h5><b>Acidic Bite (Su)</b> At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. </h5><h5><b>Charm Reptiles (Sp)</b> A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a mass charm monster spell that affects only reptilian animals. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. </h5><h5><b>Corrupt Water (Sp)</b> Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence. </h5><h5><b>Speak with Reptiles (Sp)</b> A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals. </h5><h5><b>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</b> A black dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile-<i>darkness</i> (radius 10 feet per age category); Old-plant growth; Ancient-insect plague. </h5><h5><b>Swamp Stride (Ex)</b> A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. </h5><h5><b>Water Breathing (Ex)</b> A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation.

Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's breath weapon) or be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5><h5><b>Electricity Aura (Su)</b> An adult blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. </h5><h5><b>Mirage (Su)</b> An old or older blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage. </h5><h5><b>Sandstorm (Su)</b> As a standard action, a great wyrm blue dragon can create a sandstorm centered on itself with a radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the dragon inside the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition to the normal sandstorm penalties (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431). This sandstorm lasts for up to 1 hour, but can be dismissed by the dragon as a free action.</h5><h5><b> Sound Imitation (Ex)</b> A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.</h5><h5><b> Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</b> A blue dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-ghost sound; Juvenile-minor image; Adult-ventriloquism; Old-hallucinatory terrain; Ancient- veil; Great wyrm-mirage arcana. </h5><h5><b>Storm Breath (Su)</b> An ancient or older blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions as call lightning storm, but the damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Additional uses of this ability extend the duration by an additional 1d6 rounds. <table> <tr><th>Age Category</th><th>Special Abilities</th><th>Caster Level</th></tr> <tr><td>Wyrmling</td><td>Desert thirst, immune to electricity</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Very young</td><td>Sound imitation</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Young</td><td>Ghost sound</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Juvenile</td><td>Frightful presence, minor image</td><td>1st</td></tr> <tr><td>Young adult</td><td>DR 5/magic, spell resistance</td><td>3rd</td></td></tr> <tr><td>Adult</td><td>Electricity aura, ventriloquism</td><td>5th</td></tr> <tr><td>Mature adult</td><td>DR 10/magic</td><td>7th</td></tr> <tr><td>Old</td><td>Mirage, hallucinatory terrain</td><td>9th</td></tr> <tr><td>Very old</td><td>DR 15/magic</td><td>11th</td></tr> <tr><td>Ancient</td><td>Storm breath, veil</td><td>13th</td></tr> <tr><td>Wyrm</td><td>DR 20/magic</td><td>15th</td></tr> <tr><td>Great wyrm</td><td>Sandstorm, mirage arcana</td><td>17th</td></tr> </table> </h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Blue dragons are consummate schemers and obsessively orderly.

Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's breath weapon) or be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5><h5><b>Electricity Aura (Su)</b> An adult blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. </h5><h5><b>Mirage (Su)</b> An old or older blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage. </h5><h5><b>Sandstorm (Su)</b> As a standard action, a great wyrm blue dragon can create a sandstorm centered on itself with a radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the dragon inside the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition to the normal sandstorm penalties (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431).

Young-ghost sound; Juvenile-minor image; Adult-ventriloquism; Old-hallucinatory terrain; Ancient- veil; Great wyrm-mirage arcana. </h5><h5><b>Storm Breath (Su)</b> An ancient or older blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions as call lightning storm, but the damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. </h5><h5><b>Incinerate (Su)</b> A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures in its fiery breath. A creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by its breath weapon must make a Fortitude save (using the breath weapon's DC). Failure indicates that the creature is reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only be restored to life through true resurrection or similar magic. </h5><h5><b>Manipulate Flames (Su)</b> An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires. </h5><h5><b>Melt Stone (Su)</b> An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.</h5><h5><b> Smoke Vision (Ex)</b> A very young red dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics).</h5><h5><b> Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</b> A red dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.

This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell.

It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires. </h5><h5><b>Melt Stone (Su)</b> An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools.

This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does. </h5><h5><b>Cold Aura (Su)</b> An adult white dragon radiates an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6.</h5><h5><b> Freezing Fog (Sp)</b> An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. </h5><h5><b>Ice Shape (Su)</b> A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.</h5><h5><b> Ice Tomb (Sp)</b> A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5><h5><b> Icewalking (Ex)</b> This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.</h5><h5><b> Snow Vision (Ex)</b> A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.</h5><h5><b> Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</b> A white dragon gains the following spell-like abilities usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.

This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does. </h5><h5><b>Cold Aura (Su)</b> An adult white dragon radiates an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6.</h5><h5><b> Freezing Fog (Sp)</b> An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. </h5><h5><b>Ice Shape (Su)</b> A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.</h5><h5><b> Ice Tomb (Sp)</b> A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5><h5><b> Icewalking (Ex)</b> This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.</h5><h5><b> Snow Vision (Ex)</b> A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.</h5><h5><b> Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</b> A white dragon gains the following spell-like abilities usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile-fog cloud; Young adult-gust of wind; Ancient-wall of ice; Great wyrm-control weather. <table> <tr><th>Age Category</th><th>Special Abilities</th><th>Caster Level</th></tr> <tr><td>Wyrmling</td><td>Icewalking, cold subtype</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Very young</td><td>Snow vision</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Young</td><td>Ice shape</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Juvenile</td><td>Fog cloud</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Young adult</td><td>DR 5/magic, spell resistance, gust of wind</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Adult</td><td>Cold aura, frightful presence</td><td>1st</td></tr> <tr><td>Mature adult</td><td>DR 10/magic</td><td>3rd</td></tr> <tr><td>Old</td><td>Freezing fog</td><td>5th</td></tr> <tr><td>Very old</td><td>DR 15/magic</td><td>7th</td></tr> <tr><td>Ancient</td><td>Blizzard, wall of ice</td><td>9th</td></tr> <tr><td>Wyrm</td><td>DR 20/magic</td><td>11th</td></tr> <tr><td>Great wyrm</td><td>Ice tomb, control weather</td><td>13th</td></tr> </table> </h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Although most consider it to be the weakest and most feral of the chromatic dragons, the white dragon makes up for its lack of cunning with sheer ferocity.
