The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.A <i>rod of absorption</i> can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have.

The <i>rod of lordly might</i> is metal and thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod's buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds.The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.<li>Use <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/holdPerson.html#_hold-person\">hold person</a></i> upon a touched creature, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power (a free action) and then succeed at a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.</li>\n<li>Use<i> <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/fear.html#_fear\">Fear</a></i> upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.</li>\n<li>Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half) and cure the wielder of the same amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/holdPerson.html#_hold-person\">hold person</a></i>.</li>The following functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.<li>In its normal form, the rod can be used as a <i>+2 light mace</i>. </li>\n<li>When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a <i>+1 flaming longsword</i>. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword's hilt. The weapon stretches to an overall length of 4 feet.</li>\n<li>When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a <i>+4 battleaxe</i>. A wide blade springs forth from the ball, and the whole weapon lengthens to 4 feet. </li>\n<li>When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a <i>+3 shortspear</i> or a <i>+3 longspear</i>. A spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder's choice) for an overall length ranging from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance.</li>The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.<li>When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in stone is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in a staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the climbing pole by pushing button 5.</li>\n<li>The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12.</li>\n<li>When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.</li>",

The wielder can transform these tools into the rod again with a command.Lastly, if the rod's bearer successfully disables a trap with the thieves' tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed, though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time during the next 24 hours, the rod's wielder can place the stored trap in a new location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support the trap's placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake, and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after 24 hours. This ability functions once per day.",
