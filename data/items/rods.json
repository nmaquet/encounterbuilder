She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.A rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: on a result of 71–100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.",

Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in a staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds.

It grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus on Survival checks to get along in the wild and to keep from getting lost. Additionally the wielder and any allies within a 20-foot radius of the wielder gain the benefits of the ranger's woodland stride class feature.If thrust into any natural ground or earth and allowed to stand for 1 hour, the rod grows and blooms into a large tree bearing edible fruit. A sapling rod produces 2d4 pieces of fruit. A creature that consumes an entire piece of fruit gains the benefits of either a cure moderate wounds or lesser restoration spell (recipient's choice). Consuming a piece of fruit from a sapling rod is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and no single creature can benefit from more than two piece of fruit from a single blooming. A sapling rod can bloom once per week and after doing so reverts to its original state after all the fruit is picked, or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. Fruit harvested from the tree lasts for 24 hours before shriveling into useless husks.",

Hooked at one end, a trap-stealer's rod functions as an exceptional crowbar, granting the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to force open a door or chest when using it to do such.In addition, on command, the wielder can transform the rod into a magical set of thieves' tools. Using these grant a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The wielder can transform these tools into the rod again with a command.Lastly, if the rod's bearer successfully disables a trap with the thieves' tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed, though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time during the next 24 hours, the rod's wielder can place the stored trap in a new location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support the trap's placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake, and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after 24 hours. This ability functions once per day.",
