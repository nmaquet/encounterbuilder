Viciously thorny vines erupt in a 20-foot radius from the point of impact, even if the berry misses its target. Creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw or become entangled, as the spell <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/entangle.html#_entangle\">entangle</a></i>, as the vines coil around the creature's legs. The vines persist, but at the start of the affected creature's turn, it gains a new saving throw against the effect. If the affected creature fails the saving throw, it also takes 1d4 points of damage. A DC 20 Strength check, made as a standard action, allows an affected creature to break free and end the effect. Failing the check causes the vines to constrict, dealing 1d4 points of damage.  ",
