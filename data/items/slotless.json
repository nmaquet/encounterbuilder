        "Description": "This potent magical item is a small cube fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a different plane of existence or dimension, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item chooses the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.If a side of the <i>cubic gate</i> is pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time.If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves.",

Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.If a <i>figurine of wondrous power</i> is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.<b>Bronze Griffon</b>: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor.

It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.</li>\n<li><i>The Goat of Terror</i>: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse.

The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/knock.html#_knock\">knock</a></i> spells can't open the door.The adamantine walls of an <i>instant fortress</i> have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/wish.html#_wish\">wish</a></i> or a <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/miracle.html#_miracle\">miracle</a></i>, which restores 50 points of damage taken.The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 halves).The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.",

When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.The command word can be used only once per day.If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile.

Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one.

Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains, traveling with the item.The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened.

        "Description": "This is a hand-sized replica of a wasp's nest, crafted out of paper. It is extremely fragile and comes in a snug rigid case. If the nest is placed on the floor or ground, each time a creature passes through that square there is a 50% chance that it kicks or steps on the nest, triggering it. The nest may instead be thrown (range increment 10 feet), triggering when it strikes a hard surface or a creature. When triggered, the nest creates a wasp swarm that attacks the nearest creature and follows it until it is dead, the swarm is killed, or the swarm is unable to reach the target, at which point the swarm attacks the next nearest creature. If the swarm can't find any targets, it waits in place until another creature appears. The swarm dissipates 9 minutes after being released.",

The vials are labeled \"glass,\" \"iron,\" \"paper,\" \"stone,\" and \"wood,\" and each contains a magical fluid that permanently transforms solid objects it touches into that material. Administering the fluid requires the included dropper, is a standard action, and provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to drinking a potion, and the attacker can strike at the dropper instead of the bearer). For example, using the vial marked \"paper\" on a lock transforms the lock into paper, with all of the various properties of paper (hardness, hit points, flammability, and so on). If the target object has a volume of one cubic foot or less, the transformation occurs instantly. Larger objects slowly transform at a rate of 1 hour per cubic foot of material (maximum 10 cubic feet affected). Each vial contains 5 applications of that particular fluid. Magical and attended objects may resist this transformation with a successful DC 17 Fortitude save.",

        "Description": "This fragile glass flask encloses a single scrap of worn parchment held in place by a taut metal wire threaded through its cork stopper. As a full-round action, a spellcaster can cast a targeted language-dependant spell of 3rd level or lower into the flask as a full round action, which covers the parchment with magical writing and charges the flask with power. The flask cannot be used with spells that have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Any of the spell's variables that are determined by its caster (such as commands given to the spell's target) are decided when the spell is cast into the bottle. The charged flask can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The flask shatters and is destroyed upon impact, releasing the stored spell. A creature struck by the flask is subject to the effects of spell contained within, just as if it had been the target of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of the flask when it breaks hear whispery echoes of the spell's words and are also subject to its effects, though they receive a +5 bonus on their saves to resist the spell. If the spell does not ordinarily allow a save, creatures caught in the splash radius may still make a Will save to negate it (with the +5 bonus).",
