The advantage of it is that a person can don it or remove it as a move action (there is no \"don hastily\" option for an armored coat). If worn over other armor, use the better AC bonus and worse value in all other categories; an armored coat has no effect if worn with heavy armor. The only magic effects that apply are those of armor, clothing, or items worn on top.",
