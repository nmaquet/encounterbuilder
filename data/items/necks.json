        "Description": "This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal vial containing preserved liquid blood. Each ampoule is attuned to a specific sorcerer bloodline. If a sorcerer (or other creature with sorcerer bloodline powers, such as from the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats.html#_eldritch-heritage\">Eldritch Heritage</a> feat) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline powers and gains the bloodline powers of the ampoule's bloodline, using her sorcerer level to determine the powers gained. The ampoule has no effect on the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged).The sorcerer can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the sorcerer unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed.As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a sorcerer, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule's bloodline. Bonus feats previously selected due to the sorcerer's bloodline are unaffected, but new feats must be selected from the new bloodline's bonus feat list.",

The price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above.If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.<thead><tr><th>Necklace</th><th>10d6</th><th>9d6</th><th>8d6</th><th>7d6</th><th>6d6</th><th>5d6</th><th>4d6</th><th>3d6</th><th>2d6</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Type I</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>1,650 gp</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"even\"><td>Type II</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2,700 gp</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td>Type III</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>4</td><td>—</td><td>4,350 gp</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"even\"><td>Type IV</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>4</td><td>5,400 gp</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td>Type V</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>5,850 gp</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"even\"><td>Type VI</td><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>4</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>8,100 gp</td></tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td>Type VII</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>8,700 gp</td></tr></tbody>",
