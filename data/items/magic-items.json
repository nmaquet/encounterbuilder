When closed, a Chelish crux is a wooden and metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12) that measures about 6 inches in diameter. Each face of the crux is carved with a different rune or image-in order to open the puzzle box, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time a rune is triggered in the correct order in this manner, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever a rune is triggered out of order, the light flashes into fire and inflicts 2 points of fire damage per currently lit rune on the person attempting to open the crux (Reflex DC 15 halves) and causes all lit faces to deactivate (forcing the process of opening it to start anew). Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the combination of runes to randomize to a new combination. You can simulate this puzzle for the PCs by determining the order in which the runes must be activated and then having the players stumble through the combinations, or you can allow a character a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box-each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at which point the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and causes 2 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 halves), plus 2 points for each failure. A Chelish crux can be forced open with damage or a DC 28 Strength check. The crux has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. If a crux is forced open in either of these two ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, inflicting 3d6+6 points of fire damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 halves). The fire damage affects any objects held within the crux as well. If forced open, the crux crumbles to ashes and any objects it contains appear on the ground at the site of the fiery burst. Once a particular crux's combination is known, a character can open it automatically (this takes 3 consecutive full-round actions). Opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit upon the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet's four corners as a move-equivalent action. The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time-objects that would exceed the crux's capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. A Chelish crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects, but the physical size of each object is irrelevant-the sight of a crux folding up around a long polearm, for example, might make one assume the weapon was crushed and destroyed, but when the crux is next opened, the pole arm is unharmed. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Chelish crux functions as a bag of holding for determining how long a living creature within can survive, or for what happens when the crux is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, page 500)","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest","Cost":1000,"CostUnit":"gp.","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"AP 27","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"NULL","WeightValue":"NULL","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":323},{"Name":"Grave Candle","Aura":"moderate necromancy","CL":10,"Slot":"none","Price":5500,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"1 lb.","Description":"Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth spirits from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to them for a short period of time while the candle's wick burns.

These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When it's lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke. At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak-a grave candle does not impart any additional understanding of languages. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for speak with dead (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 346), save that the dead spirit receives a -4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can only be successfully subjected to a grave candle once-the burning of the candle \"burns out\" the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's parting from the world (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit).","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, speak with dead","Cost":2750,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"AP 27","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"NULL","WeightValue":"NULL","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":324},{"Name":"Truecolor Dye","Aura":"faint divination","CL":1,"Slot":"none","Price":50,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"-","Description":"Horticulturists harvest this magical dye from the pulp of rare plants found only in the lushest regions of Tian Xia.

Truecolor dye produces vibrant colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality and temperment of the viewer-the viewer's good, neutral, or evil alignment component determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull orange. Centuries ago, truecolor dye was used in the miracle courts of Tian Xia as a way to trick emissaries into revealing their alignments, but its secret has long since been disseminated on the eastern continent and lost its hidden value. A DC 25 Knowledge (geography or nature) check reveals the dye's nature. A single vial of truecolor dye is enough to coat a square foot of material, or to ink 5 pages of text.

In addition to granting temporary hit points, the bearer of one or more of these bones is always aware of the presence of other bones of Founder Raccona within 50 feet. The bones also possess a mild drive to seek out their remaining pieces. Every time a character acquires a bone of Founder Raccona, she must make a Will save (DC 10 + the number of bones of Founder Raccona in her possession). Failure causes the character to have a dream of Founder Raccona that encourages her to seek out the other bones. This dream does not force the character to act, but suggests that seeking the remaining bones would be a benevolent act. Should all 32 bones of Founder Raccona ever be gathered together, they immediately crumble to dust and release Raccona's soul to the afterlife, losing all power.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, aid","Cost":1125,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"AP 27","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"NULL","WeightValue":"NULL","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":327},{"Name":"Clasp of the Mind Scream","Aura":"moderate evocation","CL":8,"Slot":"head","Price":12800,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"1 lb.","Description":"This strange device grants the ability to mentally communicate with others, yet proves difficult to control.

Though they once likely contained the preserved viscera of ancient Osirian scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little more than dust. Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Osirian spirit jars serve as focus items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell's need for another focus. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars. Souls within Osirian spirit jars are permanently affected by magic jar, and can potentially be kept trapped within forever. A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within an Osirian spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within an Osirian spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar's holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Osirian spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within an Osirian spirit jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends, it returns to one of the empty Osirian spirit jars if one is in range, or dies if one is not.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, magic jar","Cost":13125,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"AP 27","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"NULL","WeightValue":"NULL","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":335},{"Name":"Skin of Klendar the Troll King","Aura":"moderate conjuration","CL":8,"Slot":"armor","Price":16315,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"25 lbs.","Description":"This suit of mottled, greenish hide armor has no seams, as if it were made from a single large, disgusting skin.

It has been credited with deeds as noble as ending the life of the annis witch Traxyla of the Eye of Law (slain even as the blade's owner Ioella was beheaded by Madame Margaery) and as petty as the murder of Karian (loving mother and priestess of Sarenrae) by her estranged and vengeful husband. The blade of the willing martyr is a +3 keen vicious dagger, but its greatest power can only be invoked outside of battle. To activate this power you must spill your blood on your target, an object belonging to the target, or a physical token of the target's body (such as a few strands of hair). Your target gets a DC 23 Will save (using the same saving throw modifiers as the scrying spell for the owner's knowledge and connection to the victim) to avoid the effect, which forges a link between you and the target.

The stone can remove itself from a wayfinder to attack you in this fashion. The attack automatically wakes a sleeping character.

It provides the benefits of an iridescent spindle (sustains you without air), pearly white spindle (regenerate 1 hit point per 10 minutes), and an orange prism (+1 caster level). However, it has two drawbacks. First, once set loose to orbit your head, it dislikes being contained (including being placed in a wayfinder) and frees itself to orbit again 1d4+1 hours after being removed from its spinning path. Second, it drains the power out of other ioun stones, rendering them dull gray and powerless at a rate of one every 24 hours. Thus, it is an excellent and valuable item if you only have one ioun stone, but hard to conceal and dangerous to your other treasures. A remove curse or similar spell can put the stone at rest and prevent it from returning to its orbit. The Society has at least three specimens of this type locked in the Vaults to prevent ignorant Pathfinders from ruining perfectly good ioun stones. In theory you could place one directly into a wayfinder rather than ever letting it orbit, though conflicting reports suggest the sepia ellipsoid may be able to drain power out of orbiting stones even when contained in this way. The specimens in the Vaults are carefully locked in lead boxes to prevent them from draining the powers of other stored ioun stones.","Requirements":"Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mage's disjunction, regenerate, water breathing, creator must be 12th level","Cost":34000,"CostUnit":"gp.","Group":"Weapon","Source":"Seekers","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"NULL","WeightValue":"NULL","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":526},{"Name":"Crystal Ball standard","Aura":"moderate divination","CL":10,"Slot":"none","Price":42000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"7 lbs.","Description":"This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter.

At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used. • The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. • The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial).

Only the person a bag of concealment is keyed to may access its contents. Any others who look in the bag see only the inside of an empty sack, with dimensions matching the bag's outside measurements, as the true contents are kept separate and undetectable in the bag's magical pocket dimension.

If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below).

More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre- Earthfall race that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen. An oculus of Abaddon appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills the holder with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes 1d8 points of damage, 1 point of bleed damage, and 2 points of Constitution damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can only be removed by ripping it free (causing the same amount of damage as the initial plucking). An oculus placed in an empty eye socket immediately heals all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus allows its new owner to utilize its powers, as listed below. • Darkvision to a range of 120 feet (constant) • True seeing once per day as a free action • Greater scrying three times per day • Planar binding once per week (only to summon natives of Abaddon, such as daemons or soul eaters) • Familiar farsight at will (if the user has a familiar or an animal companion, he may use clairaudience/clairvoyance to observe the world through his familiar, despite any intervening distance as long as he and the familiar are on the same plane) The oculus of Abaddon's greatest power, though, is its haunting beckon. This ability is usable once per year, and allows the user to manipulate the minds of a huge number of targets, provided that the end goal of the manipulation is a tragic or otherwise horrific fate for those being manipulated. This functions as mass charm monster, but with a range of 1 mile, and establishes a telepathic link between the caster and all minds in that area. The effects are still language-dependant despite this telepathy-creatures without the ability to understand language (typically, creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower) are unaffected. All other creatures are automatically affected unless they have 6 or more HD, in which case they gain a DC 22 Will save to resist the effects. Spell resistance applies regardless of HD.

Shovel: Pressing this button makes the rod cycle between a short-handled shovel, a long-handled shovel, and its basic form.

The affected creatures react negatively to effects that harm \"their\" type of undead, so \"vampires\" avoid garlic, \"wraiths\" recoil from sunlight, and so on. The creatures otherwise continue to believe they are actually undead and ignore all evidence to the contrary.

However, once the owner of the window uses it to spy on hostile creatures, its curse activates. From that moment on, the window presents its owner and anyone looking through the window with an artificial image of the other side designed to lull them into a sense of false confidence- enemies appear sleeping or drunk, pits have obvious plank bridges for easy crossing, and so on.

This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. Though created by the legendary Storm King millennia ago, the cloud castle has had several masters since he mysteriously disappeared over a thousand years ago. Many believe the Storm King ascended to godhood, while others believe he was captured and imprisoned by a rival, a demon lord, or even a deity wishing to remove a threat, which may mean that the Storm King will one day return to reclaim his castle. In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can only view places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has been known to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities: • Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability. • Guards and wards 1/day on the central tower. • Storm of vengeance 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet). • Wind wall at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"APG","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The Cloud Castle of the Storm King can only be destroyed if it is dissipated by suitably strong winds; the only winds that can dissipate it are found only in the most turbulent reaches of the Plane of Air (of course, as nobody knows how to make it travel between planes, those wishing to destroy it must find it on the Plane of Air to have any chance to do so).

Blood spattered on the pages of the book quickly fades away, as if the damp sheets of pale parchment within possessed a thirsty, vampiric nature. A DC 12 Reflex save is enough to avoid being cut when opening this book-on a failed save, the user takes 2 points of Constitution damage. This section of the Book of the Damned serves as a catalogue of the Abyssal realms and their lords-yet just as the rulers of the Abyss wax and wane, the contents of this book shift and change as well, revealing dark secrets. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not chaotic evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward chaotic evil. These pages of the Book of the Damned are written in Abyssal. A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the arcane spells listed below. The user gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the Abyss are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within the Abyss always brings the caster to the exact location desired. The demonic section of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy tuned to attract chaotic evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with chaotic evil creatures. Three times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, desecrate, greater planar binding, insanity, rift of ruin (see page 48), summon monster VII, or unholy blight.

Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to focus the arcane rays of the device. The ancient Azlanti created the celestial lens to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars. Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing energy blasts focused directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the flame of guidance. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around the sun temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below.

The skull itself is all but indestructible, and while it can observe the world around it, its capacity to interact with that world is limited. Ydersius's clerics still receive spells from their prayers, granted by this very skull regardless of its location or who might claim the skull as their own-there is no way a mortal can block this effect. Relatively bulky, the skull itself measures nearly 5 feet long. The skull's greatest power is that it contains a god, and if reunited with the god's missing body, it can restore Ydersius to full potency as a deity. Beyond this staggering power, though, possession of the skull of Ydersius grants several powerful abilities, as outlined below. • The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area around it as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect only worshipers of Ydersius (death ward and freedom of movement), and two linked spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (dimensional anchor and bane). • Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast commune to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this power must make a DC 25 Will save each time the power is used to avoid succumbing to a feeblemind spell. • All reptilian creatures (including all worshipers of Ydersius, sorcerers with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and druids currently wildshaped into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the skull of Ydersius gain spell resistance 25 and fast healing 10. Any good-aligned creature that carries the skull of Ydersius, even via an extradimensional space such as a portable hole, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"AP 42","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"Destroying the skull of Ydersius is a near-impossible task tantamount to killing a god, though methods exist by which such a feat might be achieved. For example, should the skull be reunited with Ydersius's body, the god returns to life, though in a weakened state. This manifestation, though powerful, can be combated and even slain, though it regenerates from nearly any wound short of re-decapitation. For an instant, before the whole body begins to regenerate, Ydersius's spirt is untethered from his form. If Ydersius is dragged bodily before the throne of the goddess Pharasma in the Boneyard and slain in her presence, the death deity can judge the serpent god's momentarily freed essence in that instance, causing his body and skull to disintegrate into dust. Some suspect that a manifestation of Ydersius in the Great Beyond would prove far more powerful than one forced to manifest on the Material Plane.","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"1","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"none","WeightValue":"150","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":901},{"Name":"Totem of Angazhan","Aura":"strong necromancy and transmutation","CL":20,"Slot":"none","Weight":"150 lbs.","Description":"A totem of Angazhan is a dangerous and sinister artifact created by the demon lord Angazhan-originally, only one such totem existed, but as the reach of the Gorilla King expanded, additional totems began to appear in various hidden parts of the Mwangi Expanse, especially to the south of the Screaming Jungle in the deep, unexplored center of Garund. Each totem of Angazhan possesses a crude intelligence and can observe the world around it via true seeing. It can also hear and possesses tremorsense. All three of these senses extend to a range of 30 feet; the totem cannot detect anything beyond this range. A totem of Angazhan constantly radiates an aura of fear that fills the minds of any creatures within 30 feet with cruel memories of past lives in which they were consumed alive by apes-whether or not these past deaths are accurate is irrelevant to the sensation of horror they invoke in victims. All non-worshipers of Angazhan within this area must make a DC 15 Will save each round to avoid becoming panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Once per round, a totem of Angazhan can cast weird. This is its primary means of defense, and it can target all creatures within 30 feet that it can sense. The effect manifests at caster level 20th, and has a save DC of 23. Once per day, a totem of Angazhan can reincarnate a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the reincarnated creature always returns to life as a Chaotic Evil charau-ka. A creature reincarnated as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con. Once per year, the totem may instead use its reincarnate ability to bring a creature back to life as a Chaotic Evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature reincarnated as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con. When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor continues ruling as the Gorilla King for another year. In this fashion, the Mwangi Expanse has never gone for more than several months without a Gorilla King for the past several hundred years. As with all reincarnate effects, the creature being restored to life must be willing for the effect to work-the creature to be reincarnated knows that accepting the offer to come back to life enslaves its soul to Angazhan (resulting in the shift to Chaotic Evil and the drive to seek out and replace the current Gorilla King). If a totem of Angazhan is placed upon or adjacent to an altar of Angazhan that is under the effect of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Angazhan, the totem of Angazhan's sensory range extends to 300 feet, and it can use its abilities in this extended range as long as it has line of sight to its target.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"AP 42","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"A totem of Angazhan can be destroyed only by a Gorilla King (either acting on his own volition or while under the effects of magical control), who can damage the totem as if it were a normal item with hardness 8 and 100 hp (or with a DC 30 Strength check to break the totem in half ). Of course, once a Gorilla King makes his first attack upon one of these totems, the blasphemy against Angazhan causes that Gorilla King to no longer count as a worshiper of Angazhan, and he can now be affected by the totem's fear aura. Worse, the affront allows the totem of Angazhan to attempt once per round to revoke that Gorilla King's reincarnated body. Each round the blasphemous Gorilla King remains within reach of the totem's senses, the Gorilla King must make a DC 25 Fortitude save to avoid being transformed back into whatever race the creature was before he was reincarnated. Once this occurs, the target is no longer a Gorilla King and can no longer damage the totem, but the totem continues to use weird to attempt to slay the creature as long as it is able.","MinorArtifactFlag":"1","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"1","Transmutation":"1","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"150","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":902},{"Name":"Padma Blossom","Aura":"faint abjuration and enchantment","CL":3,"Slot":"none","Price":8000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"-","Description":"This perfect lotus flower formed from pink jade offers purity of mind and spiritual calm.

A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this \"board\" can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface-it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work. To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette's surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board-at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the seance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below. The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"maybe,\" or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day-the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a -2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The spirits in the area are not omniscient-the GM should decide whether or not the spirits would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically \"maybe.\" If the GM determines that the spirits are knowledgeable about the answer, roll d% to determine whether the spirits speak truthfully or whether they lie.

Created by the pactmasters of Katapesh to manipulate and control their constructs known as aluums, these charms are much sought after on the black market. Unauthorized possession of a charm of aluum control is considered a grave crime in Katapesh, punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well.

This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned-a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects.

The Storm Kindlers, however, were unprepared for the savagery and evil that had claimed the Sodden Lands, and they and their home were quickly wiped out.

The nascent demon lord often loans Blackaxe to favored minions, and uses this ability to reclaim his weapon should he become aware that the wielder has failed in a mission. While Blackaxe is wielded by another creature, Treerazer always knows that creature's location and status (as via the status and discern location spells), and by concentrating can observe the world around the wielder as if using that wielder's senses.

When a final blade scythes down to decapitate the target, treat this as a coup de grace attempt on the victim that inflicts 6d6+12 points of damage. A final blade's damage penetrates all damage reduction (save epic damage reduction) and negates all regeneration effects.

Despite the lich's power, Arnisant was protected from the onslaught by his magical shield, an artifact known as the Shield of Aroden. When the two finally faced off, the Whispering Tyrant attempted to use a wish to summon Arnisant's heart to his waiting claws. The Shield of Aroden prevented this dire fate and instead shattered into a dozen fragments, one of which appeared in Tar-Baphon's hand, fusing with the undead flesh and burning the lich with holy fire. When the flames subsided, the crippled lich was soon locked away in the dungeons beneath Gallowspire, there to rot for all eternity. The Shield of Aroden lost all of its power. Its broken remnants have been passed down from one watcher-lord to another without fail. Some say that should the Whispering Tyrant ever become free, the missing piece of the shield would have to be recovered from his bony claw for the fiend to truly be defeated. This item is normally kept on display in the city of Vigil in Lastwall, though at first glance it is just a collection of wooden shards on a large black silk pillow. If assembled, these 12 shards would form a round shield with a piece in the center missing. The shield's face is carved to look like Aroden's holy symbol-a winged eye in a circle. Originally known as the Shield of Aroden, most today call it by its new name-the Shattered Shield of Arnisant. If restored to its former glory (a task that could in and of itself be a campaign), the Shattered Shield becomes the Shield of Aroden once again-a +5 light fortification spell resistance (17) heavy wooden shield. Once per day, you can invoke a form of fire shield that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage like a flame strike (it is likely that this ability is what burned the lich in his final battle). Once per round as an immediate action, if an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, you can use the shield to redirect the attack to yourself, suffering all effects from that attack as if you were its intended target. All allies within 100 feet of you gain the effect of bless and prayer. As with a status spell, all allies within 100 feet know your relative position and condition. The Shield of Aroden bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. The negative levels remain as long as the shield is held or carried. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature holds or carries the shield.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Inner Sea World Guide","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The Shield of Aroden has the special purpose of protecting its bearer from death no matter the consequences to itself. Any attack that would kill you (not merely make you unconscious or dying) triggers this ability, redirecting the attack fully upon the shield and leaving you unharmed, even if the attack normally only works on living creatures. For example, if you failed a saving throw against flesh to stone, the shield would turn to stone instead of you, whereas if you failed your save against horrid wilting or implosion, the shield would turn to dry splinters or crushed pulp. Depending on the nature of the attack, it may be impossible to reassemble or restore the shield to full functionality again. Any attempt to repair the shield requires all of its pieces, and barring the direct intercession of a deity, it is likely that any repairs would be imperfect. Anytime the bearer fails a saving throw by rolling a 1, the shield must attempt the same saving throw (regardless whether the shield would normally be the item to suffer the effects of failure), and if it fails by rolling 1, it shatters again, perhaps with disastrous effects. Despite their lack of active magic, the individual pieces themselves cannot be damaged by mortal means.","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"1","Abjuration":"1","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"10","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":916},{"Name":"Sun Orchid Elixir","Aura":"strong necromancy","CL":17,"Slot":"none","Weight":"-","Description":"Thuvia's sun orchid elixir is a nearly perfect solution for those who seek eternal life. A single dose of sun orchid elixir cannot stop the aging process, but it does the next-best thing-it restores youth. A creature that drinks the elixir is restored to its starting age as a young adult. The drinker's new age is randomly determined using Table 7-1 on page 169 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution the drinker may have suffered as a result of advanced age are removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma that result from advanced age remain (although as the character ages again into middle age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a second time). Vanity-seekers go to nearly any length to acquire the elixir, resorting to bribery, extortion, and murder. To curtail such troubles in the land of its creation, the use of the elixir is outlawed in Thuvia (except by the formula's creator).

The invention of the first wardstones, giant menhirs infused with holy magic meant to contain and repel demonic creatures, was perhaps the greatest result of the crusader's initial response to Sarkoris's destruction. Today, dozens of wardstones stand sentinel along the borders of the Worldwound. The primary purpose of the wardstones is to contain the growing influence of the Worldwound itself, but they also exude a powerful field similar to that generated by a forbiddance spell. A single wardstone exerts this aura in a 300-foot radius, but when multiple wardstones are linked (as in the case of those running along the border of the Worldwound), they create a 300-footwide path of forbiddance, with the wardstones running down the middle. The forbiddance area, be it a radius or path, deals 12d6 points of damage per round to any demon within that area (DC 18 Will save half; spell resistance applies). Teleportation effects do not function in this zone at all. The wardstones that bolster the eastern and southern borders of the Worldwound have a further effect as well-focused on the Worldwound as they are, they prevent demons from teleporting into or out of the Worldwound and effectively contain the threat. The arrangement of the wardstones along the Mendev, Numeria, and Ustalav borders is such that even the unwarded borders to the west and north work to hamper demonic incursions.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Inner Sea World Guide","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"If a wardstone misses its yearly maintenance ritual, it becomes vulnerable to damage.

Chomper hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction. Chomper has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 539), along with the following additional powers. Bite: As a standard action, Chomper's possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any target within a 5-foot radius. The possessor targets a single creature or unattended item with this attack. Chomper (not the wielder) makes a single bite attack against the creature or item targeted: bite +14 (1d10+5 and bleed 2). This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity, despite the quasit's Tiny size. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities-Azrikalis cannot modify his attack roll with his Dexterity modifier, for example, nor can he use Chomper to make sneak attacks. Hateful Curse: When a non-demon is in possession of Chomper, the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If Chomper manages to seize control of a non-demon host through personality conflict, it directs its host to seek out victims to feed to it.","Requirements":"bag of holding type III","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"Rival Gudie","AL":"CE","Int":10,"Wis":"14","Cha":13,"Ego":"13 (17 against any non-demon)","Communication":"speech (Abyssal)","Senses":"30 ft., blindsense","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"1","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"15","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":924},{"Name":"Cockatrice Grit","Aura":"moderate transmutation","CL":11,"Slot":"none","Price":2000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"-","Description":"This magical grit is used by flinging a dose at a creature within 15 feet by as a ranged touch attack.

Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think. Dials on the cylinder's side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder's surface. The brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. The mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this grisly manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes. A brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has hardness 10 and 30 hit points-cylinders made of other materials might have higher or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from whom the brain was harvested is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only powerful effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder only accounts for the basic creation-the brain of a particularly knowledgeable creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, magic jar, 7 ranks in Heal","Cost":2500,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"AP 46","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"1","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"moderate","WeightValue":"10","PriceValue":5000,"CostValue":2500,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":940},{"Name":"Moribund Key","Aura":"strong necromancy","CL":12,"Slot":"none","Price":40000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"1/2 lb.","Description":"Greater agents of the Whispering Way use these silver medallions as keys to their sanctuaries.

Should no Amatatsus of pure blood be able to take up that charge, however, the Amatatsu Seal can invest the right to rule as an Amatatsu in any number of living humanoid hosts. These Amatatsu scions often experience a series of visions of the past, present, and possible future. The Amatatsu Seal has a daily allotment of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion: cure serious wounds, remove curse, remove disease, or restoration. Each casting uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast heal on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so expends all 5 charges. Finally, and only at the seal's discretion, it can cast resurrection on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so renders its spellcasting powers useless for a month. The Amatatsu Seal itself radiates strong magic, and those with the proper resources can sense this magic across oceans and continents, allowing it to be tracked across any distance. Originally meant to allow its rightful owners the ability to track it if stolen, this feature makes it dangerous to remove the seal from its warding box, for as long as the warding box is open, the oni of the Five Storms can track it. The repercussions of this are detailed in later adventures in the Jade Regent Adventure Path. One final ward exists on the Amatatsu Seal, confounding attempts to whisk it quickly away from its homeland but also making returning a stolen seal home an arduous task. The Amatatsu Seal can never be transported by teleportation magic or dimensional travel. It cannot be taken from the Material Plane save via special portals blessed by the gods, and characters who carry the seal cannot cast or otherwise use teleportation effects.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"AP 49","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"To destroy the Amatatsu Seal, rightful scions of each of the five royal families of Minkai must, of their own free will, cast their families' seals together into the Well of Demons in the Imperial Shrine in Kasai Harbor.","MinorArtifactFlag":"1","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"0","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":953},{"Name":"Dancing Wasp","Aura":"moderate conjuration","CL":7,"Slot":"none","Price":12392,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"3 lbs.","Description":"This +1 kusarigama (Ultimate Combat 132) makes a shrill whistling sound whenever it is used in combat.

According to these stories, the helms not only mask the wearers' faces, but also function as helms of telepathy combined with amulets of proof against detection and location. The wearer of a Decemvirate helm can use disguise self at will and benefits from discern lies and true seeing at all times. The helm provides 100% protection from all gaze attacks and all forms of magical control. Specific Decemvirate helms may have additional powers as well- certainly, all are said to be unique in physical appearance. Of course, beyond these few details that most Pathfinders hold as fact, little is known about the helms, and they remain some of the Pathfinder Society's greatest and most secret treasures-if one were to fall into the possession of anyone other than a Decemvirate member, the Society would undoubtedly spare no expense in retrieving the item.

The ancestral blade of the Amatatsu family, Suishen is believed to contain the soul of the first Amatatsu emperor of Minkai. It has been passed down through generations of the family, serving as advisor and spiritual guide. It was actually Suishen's idea to be sold to Fynn Snaevald in order to save the family line. Suishen can detect any scion of the Amatatsu family within 60 feet, whether a natural-born descendant or a person invested with the right to rule as an Amatatsu (such as a creature marked by the Amatatsu Seal). Although Suishen is neutral good, any Amatatsu scion, regardless of alignment, can wield the sword without gaining a negative level. This boon is at Suishen's discretion, however, and should such a scion ever betray the family or prove unworthy as an heir, the sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict. Even though Suishen can likely dominate anyone who tries to wield it, the sword usually acquiesces to the wishes of its wielder, provided she is a rightful Amatatsu scion-though after 50 years of holding its silence, Suishen is a bit rough as a conversationalist, communicating in a very gruff, no-nonsense manner. Suishen has a number of additional abilities as well, though it reveals these powers to its wielder only after she has shown herself honorable and worthy of bearing the family's heirloom blade. Each time Suishen's wielder is involved in a fight in which an oni of the Five Storms (such as Kimandatsu) is killed, the wielder is made aware of one new power in the following order. If a new person wields Suishen, that person must learn the sword's additional powers all over again. • Resist energy (cold) 3/day becomes protection from energy (cold) at will. • Suishen gains the flaming burst ability. • Invisibility purge at will. • Suishen gains the bane ability against creatures with the oni subtype.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"AP 50","AL":"NG","Int":12,"Wis":"16","Cha":13,"Ego":"25","Communication":"speech, telepathy","Senses":"60 ft., darkvision, detect Amatatsu scions, read languages","Powers":"Constant-endure elements 3/day-air walk, daylight, resist energy (cold), see invisibility","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"Suishen is destroyed if the blade is used to slay the last Amatatsu scion.","MinorArtifactFlag":"1","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"1","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"6","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"Common, Tien","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":999},{"Name":"Banner of the Ancient Kings","Aura":"moderate abjuration","CL":8,"Slot":"none","Price":18000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"5 lbs.","Description":"This tattered white canvas banner looks like an old piece of sailcloth, or perhaps a winding shroud-a 4-foot-by-6-foot rectangle with loops that can fit over a spear haft or pole running up one side. If mounted on a longspear or pole at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner's personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder's deity). When carried into battle, a banner of the ancient kings confers several benefits. As long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the banner of the ancient kings- once he releases his firm grip on the banner's haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect. If the banner's carrier possesses the Flagbearer feat (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 286), the banner of the ancient kings doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A bard who carries a longspear or pole to which a banner of the ancient kings has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual bard level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage bardic performance ability.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, heroism, resistance","Cost":9000,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"Lands Of The Linnorm Kings","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"1","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"moderate","WeightValue":"5","PriceValue":18000,"CostValue":9000,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":1000},{"Name":"Harp of Storms","Aura":"moderate evocation","CL":7,"Slot":"none","Price":22000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"2 lbs.","Description":"This small harp is carved from whale ivory, and its frame is filigreed with delicate gold patterns depicting winds and clouds.

The daemonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between covers of perpetually frozen and compressed ashes that seem to suck away ambient light into their material. All known copies of the text appear to be some variety of palimpsest, with the words written over the intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown when and by whom this redaction took place. In each case, the edited portions describe specific names relating to the earliest history of the plane, sometimes with entire pages being censored. Scholars suspect this is related to the same magic utilized by the Horsemen to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the Four has been replaced. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not neutral evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward neutral evil. Written in a mixture of Abyssal and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other mid-sentence, the text requires true fluency in both languages to fully understand the nuances and true meaning of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to \"speak\" to him, inserting telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A telepathic creature may \"read\" the text without actually opening the book merely by holding it and concentrating. A reader who splashes his own blood onto the book (which is promptly absorbed) and spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the spells on pages 38-39 and those listed below. The user gains at +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks when using the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). Any energy-draining spell cast by the bearer bestows +1 additional negative level on affected creatures. The daemonic portion of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract neutral evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if he were two caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with neutral evil creatures. Four times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death, energy drain, death knell, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 39). It is believed that the bearer can be scried at any time, without a saving throw, by the Four Horsemen or their elite agents.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Horsemen Of The Apocalypse","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The daemonic Book of the Damned can be destroyed by washing away the text on each page with the tears of a good outsider, at which point the book crumbles to ashes.

When burned, the candle sheds eerie illumination in a radius of 15 feet, similar to Abaddon's perpetual eclipse. A spellcaster within the radius of the burning candle gains a +2 bonus to caster level when casting spells with the evil descriptor. The light also acts as a magic circle against evil, but only against daemons. Within the light, all creatures take 1 point of damage per round, natural healing doesn't work, and magical healing requires a DC 24 caster level check to succeed. A candle normally burns for 4 hours, and any burning consumes at least 1 minute of its power. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like.

Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes. Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book.

The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power.

Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse. The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below. Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level. Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards. Euryale: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent. The Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation. Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days. Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester. Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each. Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional. Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional. Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand. Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat. Moon: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received. Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect. Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost. Skull: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone- if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle. Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated. Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck. Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour). Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely. The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment.

A single philosopher's stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp).

Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character. A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action. Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30. If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.

All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs. The owner of an Orb knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb's particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each Orb also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th. • Black Dragon Orb: Fly. • Blue Dragon Orb: Haste. • Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport. • Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying (Will DC 18 negates). • Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion (Will DC 17 negates). • Gold Dragon Orb: The owner of the gold Orb can call upon any power possessed by one of the other Orbs-including the dominate and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity-but can only use an individual power once per day. She can dominate any other possessor of an Orb within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates). • Green Dragon Orb: Spectral hand. • Red Dragon Orb: Wall of fire. • Silver Dragon Orb: Cure critical wounds (Will DC 18 half ). • White Dragon Orb: Protection from energy (cold) (Fortitude DC 17 negates)","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"PFRPG Core","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"An orb of dragonkind immediately shatters if it is caught in the breath weapon of a dragon who is a blood relative of the dragon trapped within.

The tarnished bronze coin has a square central hole and bears six ideograms on its two faces-four on one face and two on the other, with two spaces apparently left blank. A leather thong is threaded through the coin's central hole, allowing the coin to be worn around the neck. The six ideograms on the coin correspond to six different skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth. A DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) or DC 20 Linguistics check identifies the ideograms and their corresponding skills. The shinobi fuhonsen currently has six powers, each corresponding to one of the six ideograms and its associated skill. If a new owner has at least 8 ranks in another skill, the shinobi fuhonsen gains an additional power based on that skill, and a new ideogram emerges on the coin's surface. The new power and the skill it corresponds to are left up to the GM, though the power should be related to its skill, and the skill should be one on which the owner often relies. Although the existing powers of the shinobi fuhonsen are based on skills common to rogues and bards, new powers and their corresponding skills are not restricted to those of any one class. Only one new power may be unlocked per owner. The coin's powers only function for a worthy owner, who must have at least 8 ranks in each of the six skills, plus 8 ranks in another skill. If the bearer of the coin is not a worthy owner (i.e., does not have enough skill ranks), the coin vanishes from the bearer's possession at the next new moon, reappearing elsewhere in Minkai to seek out a new owner. When a new owner first takes possession of the shinobi fuhonsen and activates a new power, the new ideogram (and its associated power) appears on the coin on a temporary basis, and the owner receives a vision of the coin's previous owners at the time of their deaths. If the new owner is not chaotic evil, he must immediately make a DC 25 Will save or his alignment shifts one step toward chaotic evil. If the save succeeds, the owner resists the change and can use the coin's powers until the next new moon, when he must make another save. The owner must make a new Will save at every new moon until his alignment becomes chaotic evil, or until the artifact is no longer in his possession. As long as the owner is not chaotic evil, he can simply discard the shinobi fuhonsen, at which point the coin vanishes at the next new moon. Once the owner becomes chaotic evil, the new ideogram (and its associated power) becomes permanent and he can no longer discard the coin, as if it were a cursed item. Each of the coin's powers can be activated by speaking the name of the corresponding ideogram, unless otherwise noted. The known powers (and their associated skills) of the shinobi fuhonsen are as follows. • Power #1 (Acrobatics): The owner can cast shadow walk once per day. • Power #2 (Climb): The owner can cast spider climb three times per day. • Power #3 (Disguise): The owner is permanently under the effects of misdirection. • Power #4 (Escape Artist): The owner can cast dimension door three times per day. • Power #5 (Perception): The owner can cast scrying once per day. • Power #6 (Stealth): The owner can cast mislead once per day. • Powers #7-8 (8 ranks in another skill): Yet to be discovered.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"AP 53","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The shinobi fuhonsen can be destroyed if it is swallowed by an ancient sovereign dragon (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3).

Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted. While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects. s can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie. Undead that contain such an item benefit from the +2 bonus hit points per Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced desecrate spell.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead, desecrate, Creator must have 5 ranks in Knowledge (religion)","Cost":1750,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"AP 57","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"1","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"faint","WeightValue":"1","PriceValue":2500,"CostValue":1750,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":1089},{"Name":"Farwatcher","Aura":"moderate divination","CL":11,"Slot":"none","Price":120850,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"260 lbs.","Description":"This exquisite telescope is crafted of brass, ivory, wood, and carefully polished crystal lenses and silver mirrors, and is over 10 feet long.

Whenever Chellan strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slowed as per the spell slow (CL 16th). If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be turned into a crystalline statue, as if by flesh to stone. Characters turned to crystal by Chellan appear to be made of ruby, diamond, or some other valuable gem, but are in fact merely colored quartz of little value to looters. Fanatical in the extreme, Chellan seeks to force its wielder into serving Karzoug and furthering the runelord's goals. To enforce this purpose of their existence, it can use its intelligence and special abilities to aid and manipulate those who think to wield it.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"RotRL-AE-Appendix","AL":"LE","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"25","Communication":"telepathy","Senses":"sight and hearing (30 ft.)

Closer inspection reveals the paradox box to be a solid piece of stone that's been carved to resemble a box-it has no seam for a lid or hinges to allow opening. It is a secure storage device that can be accessed only by use of the proper command word or combination. Until the command word is intoned or the combination is correctly entered (the box's creator decides which method of opening works for the box-most boxes have combination locks that function similarly to the one detailed on page 9), the box is effectively a solid piece of stone with no lid or aperture or even an interior, and as such, attempts to open the box by bypassing a lock (with Disable Device or knock) do not work. Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard model. Once the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again simply by closing it. The contents of the storage space do not change the weight of the chest, since they actually stay in an otherwise inaccessible extradimensional space. If the chest is destroyed (hardness 8, hp 90), the extradimensional space collapses and any contents are jettisoned randomly into the Ethereal Plane. Paradox boxes were especially popular in Thassilon for their relative inexpensiveness as well as their superior security and durability. Many Thassilonian creators, burdened with arrogance and hubris, constructed their paradox boxes such that their surfaces were decorated with elaborate and carefully constructed riddles or wordplays that gave clues to their command words. These items are prize finds for organizations such as the Pathfinder Society, because a particularly clever investigator can often still open them, revealing their time-lost secrets even though the command word might have been lost millennia ago.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, arcane lock, secret chest","Cost":2500,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"AP 61","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"1","Conjuration":"1","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"moderate","WeightValue":"30","PriceValue":5000,"CostValue":2500,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":1200},{"Name":"Pendant Of The Souk","Aura":"faint divination","CL":3,"Slot":"neck","Price":4000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"-","Description":"This golden pendant is of Qadiran make.

Doing so requires a Spellcraft check (DC = 20 + double spell level)-failure indicates the archive opens to a random spell from this chapter's seven earlier options. Whatever spell the anathema archive i s o pened t o, t he u ser may cast that spell from the scroll as if she were casting a spell from a normal scroll, save that the spell is not consumed from the anathema archive upon being cast.

Its side is marked with the Sihedron Rune, while many other Thassilonian runes grace its rim. A runeslave cauldron has the ability to infuse the body of a freshly slain giant, reviving it and transforming it into a runeslave (see page 412). Before it can be used, the runeslave cauldron must first be activated by filling it with a specially prepared broth of rare necromantic ingredients and rainwater collected from several open graves. The cost of the special ingredients is 10,000 gp, but once the cauldron is filled, a fire lights under it automatically and keeps the broth bubbling and functional for 1 year. Once the cauldron is filled with broth, one need only sacrifice a giant (the method of killing the giant is incidental) and then place the giant's corpse wholly or partially within the cauldron's bubbling contents. One hour later, the sacrificed giant rises from the cauldron as if true resurrection had been cast on it. In addition, the newly revived giant gains the runeslave template (see page 412). The cauldron can revive up to five giants a day in this manner. Non-giant corpses placed in the broth are unaffected by the cauldron's magic. Any living creature (save for a runeslave) completely immersed in the boiling broth inside a functional runeslave cauldron immediately takes 6d6 points of fire damage per round. In addition, the smoke produced by the cauldron as it boils is particularly noxious to good-aligned beings. It spreads to a radius of 30 feet around the cauldron, and while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision, its foul-smelling vapors sting and burn those of good alignment. Each round such a creature remains in the smoke, he must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded and nauseated for as long as he remains in the area plus an additional 1d6 rounds after leaving the area.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"RotRL-AE-Appendix","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"By brewing a certain variant mixture of broth and then attempting to use the runeslave cauldron to transform a good-aligned giant who volunteers for the job, the cauldron can be caused to crack open across the Sihedron carving.

Many of these minor runewells of wrath existed in her domain-though today most are lost deep under the waters of the Varisian Gulf or are hidden away in Hollow Mountain, with only the one remaining on mainland Avistan hidden in the Catacombs of Wrath under Sandpoint. Every time a creature with a wrathful soul (including most goblins and quite a few of the victims murdered years ago by Jervas Stoot) dies within a mile of a minor runewell, it gains 1 wrath point. There's no limit to the number of wrath points the minor runewell can store, but it currently contains only 20. Each time the well's waters are drawn upon (as detailed below), a number of wrath points are expended. If enough points are expended to put its total at 0 or negative wrath points, the minor runewell deactivates, its waters fading away. Reactivating the minor runewell requires long-lost rituals-or the reactivation of a major runewell somewhere else in the world. Such an event restores a minor runewell of wrath to a starting level of 3 wrath points. A minor runewell is only 3 feet deep, yet any living creature that enters its freezing orange waters immediately takes 2d6 points of cold damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be overcome with wrath. Failure indicates the creature becomes enraged (as if under the effects of a rage spell) and immediately attacks the nearest living creature. If no living creatures are in sight, the enraged creature is compelled to seek out a victim, moving at full speed in its search. This rage persists for 2d6 minutes, after which point the creature becomes fatigued. Each activation of a minor runewell in this manner costs 3 wrath points. A minor runewell can also be commanded to disgorge a sinspawn. To manifest a sinspawn, a creature need only allow a few drops of its blood to fall into the pool. One round later, a sinspawn emerges from the well and immediately attacks the closest creature in which it cannot scent wrath.

The runewell itself is a core part of the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path, but by the time the PCs arrive at the Eye of Avarice, the circular well (which appears to be filled with molten gold) has already done its job absorbing fragments of greedy souls and is in the process of using that energy to finalize Karzoug's escape. Beyond this effect, though, Karzoug can utilize the runewell in other ways. It grants him the ability to use scrying at will, although the runewell's range is limited to the Xin-Shalast region or to specific agents like Mokmurian, Xanesha, and Lucrecia. Creatures that wear magic items marked with the Sihedron take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. The runewell allows Karzoug to see through the eyes and speak through the mouths of anyone who wears a Sihedron medallion (see p age 426). H e can also, given time, call up from the runewell a live adult blue dragon minion to serve him as an ally or mount. This essentially functions as a gate spell, save that the dragon is actually created by the runewell rather than called. Karzoug can only have one such dragon in existence at any one time, and must wait 8 hours after a previous dragon's death before calling a new blue dragon to serve him. The runewell itself is 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. The liquid it contains functions in all ways as molten gold-dealing damage is if it were lava upon creatures splashed or immersed within it. Gold drawn from the runewell cools normally and is permanent-the runewell immediately replenishes gold taken from its supplies-yet this gold cannot exist more than 30 feet from the runewell's rim. If brought beyond this range, it vanishes in an instant.

Thus, Karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is unknown to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change. See page 324 for more details on the ramifications of wearing a Sihedron medallion in Xin-Shalast. While worn, a Sihedron medallion grants its wearer a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

The distance to each target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a -4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the returning property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not the others.

Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack. In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2). The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The sun blade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60- foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging the sword, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded.

Once a ring is fitted to the tenth slot, the sword's wielder can employ that ring as if he were wearing it, even if he is currently wearing two magic rings. Alternatively, the sword's wielder can fit a ring made of a specific metal like adamantine or cold iron into the tenth slot. Doing so allows the sword to penetrate damage reduction as if it were made of the same metal as the ring. Using this property does not grant the weapon any additional properties of that metal (such as bypassing hardness, etc.). Typically, such metal rings cost one-tenth the cost of a nine-ring broadsword made from that material.

Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made. Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong. If she is weak, they hate and desire to slay her. The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows. ELEMENT SAVING THROW PENALTY Air -2 against earth-based effects Earth -2 against air- or electricity-based effects Fire -2 against water- or cold-based effects Water -2 against fire-based effects In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.

At night or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command. • Dancing lights (once per hour) • Light (twice per night) • Ball lightning (special, once per night) • Shooting stars (special, three per week) The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the wearer controls them similarly (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created. NUMBER OF BALLS DAMAGE PER BALL 1 lightning ball 2d6 points of electricity damage 2 lightning balls 3d6 points of electricity damage 3 lightning balls 2d6 points of electricity damage 4 lightning balls 1d6 points of electricity damage Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round. The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. Upon impact, they deal 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere that deals 24 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from the impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. The range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a successful DC 13 Reflex save or be hit by the projectile. Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties. • Faerie fire (once per day) • Spark shower (special, once per day) The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arch 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons. Any creature wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon takes 4d8 points of damage.","Requirements":"Forge Ring, faerie fire, fireball, light, lightning bolt","Cost":25000,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Ring","Source":"Ultimate Equipment","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"1","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"0","PriceValue":50000,"CostValue":25000,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":1443},{"Name":"Ring Of Spell Knowledge Type I","Aura":"moderate or strong (no school)","CL":7,"Slot":"ring","Price":1500,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"-","Description":"This ring comes in four types: ring of spell knowledge I, ring of spell knowledge II, ring of spell knowledge III, and ring of spell knowledge IV.

The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character holding the rod or her gear. The rod then nullifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time. A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know. A rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy. To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2.

The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. • When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in stone is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in a staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds.

Fruit harvested from the tree lasts for 24 hours before shriveling into useless husks.","Requirements":"Craft Rod, cure moderate wounds, grove of respite (Advanced Player's Guide), lesser restoration","Cost":8325,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Rod","Source":"Ultimate Equipment","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"1","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"1","AuraStrength":"moderate","WeightValue":"5","PriceValue":16650,"CostValue":8325,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":1512},{"Name":"Scepter Of Heaven","Aura":"moderate evocation","CL":10,"Slot":"none","Price":74000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"3 lbs.","Description":"This ornate scepter of bronze and mithral has a flanged head like a golden-white sunburst.

If the wielder of a scepter of heaven wears a crown of heaven, the scepter's caster level increases to 15th (increasing its aura to strong) and, when used as a weapon, it gains the holy property. A good-aligned wielder may also use holy smite, holy sword, and holy word, as the spells, once per day each. A scepter of heaven is of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level.

Hooked at one end, a trap-stealer's rod functions as an exceptional crowbar, granting the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to force open a door or chest when using it to do such. In addition, on command, the wielder can transform the rod into a magical set of thieves' tools. Using these grant a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The wielder can transform these tools into the rod again with a command. Lastly, if the rod's bearer successfully disables a trap with the thieves' tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed, though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time during the next 24 hours, the rod's wielder can place the stored trap in a new location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support the trap's placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake, and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after 24 hours. This ability functions once per day.","Requirements":"Craft Rod, create pit, knock, plane shift","Cost":6750,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Rod","Source":"Ultimate

The staff allows the use of the following spells: • Continual flame (1 charge) • Fireball (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • Levitate (1 charge) • Lightning bolt (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • Magic missile (1 charge) • Ray of enfeeblement (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • Cone of cold (2 charges) • Globe of invulnerability (2 charges) • Hold monster (2 charges) • Wall of force (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only, 2 charges) The wielder of a staff of power gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (a free action), the staff deals double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round. A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures and objects within 2 squares of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 20 x the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 15 x the number of charges, and those 5 or 6 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 10 x the number of charges. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence (01-50 on a d%), but if she does not, the explosive release of spell energy instantly destroys her. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.","Requirements":"Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Staff, cone of cold, continual flame, heightened fireball, globe of invulnerability, hold monster, levitate, heightened lightning bolt, magic missile, heightened ray of enfeeblement, wall of force","Cost":117500,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Staff","Source":"Ultimate Equipment","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"5","PriceValue":235000,"CostValue":117500,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"+2 quarterstaff","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":1650},{"Name":"Staff Of Radiance","Aura":"moderate evocation","CL":8,"Slot":"none","Price":23200,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"5 lbs.","Description":"This silver-tipped willow staff constantly emits light, as if from a light spell-the radiance is emitted from the staff's metallic end and flickers as if with flame.

When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows: • Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20) • Ruby: Wall of fire • Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half) • Opal: Daylight The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated. It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range. The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources. Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it. If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer.

Neither of these features function across planar boundaries. The soulbound eye's wearer is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, but the master can use the soulbound eye as a conduit for hold monster, modify memory, pain strike (Advanced Player's Guide), and suggestion spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell no matter the distance between master and wearer.

The ampoule has no effect on the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged). The sorcerer can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the sorcerer unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed. As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a sorcerer, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule's bloodline.

Arming Sword: When detached, this charm transforms into a masterwork heavy wooden shield and a masterwork longsword. They can either appear on the ground or within the hands of the creature that activated the charm, ready to use. These items last for 1 hour before turning into vapor. Healthy Apple: When detached, this charm becomes an apple that when eaten (a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity) heals 2d8 hit points. In addition, if the creature eating the apple is afflicted with any poison or diseases, it can attempt a new saving throw against each such affliction. Each successful saving throw immediately ends the corresponding affliction. Loving Heart: Upon detaching this charm, the wearer can use charm person as a spell-like ability (as the spell, Will DC 11) any time before the end of her next turn. Lucky Star: When this charm is activated, it releases good luck in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the wearer. The wearer and her allies within the burst gain a +2 luck bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. Peaceful Dove: Detaching this dove calms tempers within a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the wearer as though calm emotions (Will DC 13) had been cast. A creature affected by rage takes a -2 penalty on this saving throw. Reduce the price of a charm bracelet that has one or more expended charms by 1,580 gp per absent charm.

When carried close to the body of a creature continuously for 1 week, the gem harmlessly absorbs a portion of that creature's life essence.

If the bearer gains one or more negative levels, the black soul shard absorbs one of these negative levels into itself, negating the effect. The black soul shard can only absorb a negative level if carried by the person it is attuned to. If an attuned black soul shard is used as an additional focus component for raising the attuned creature from the dead, the negative level cost of being raised is one less than normal (minimum 1), but only if the spell is cast within 24 hours of the creature's death. Absorbing a negative level (whether from an attack or raising the attuned creature from the dead) destroys the portion of the soul within a black soul shard. This does not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for another week for it to function again. A creature can only have one black soul shard attuned to it at a time.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, death ward, restoration","Cost":6000,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"Ultimate Equipment","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"1","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"moderate","WeightValue":"0","PriceValue":12000,"CostValue":6000,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2174},{"Name":"Blessed Book","Aura":"moderate transmutation","CL":7,"Slot":"none","Price":12500,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"1 lb.","Description":"This well-made tome is always of small size, typically no more than 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch thick.

When filled with the wearer's blood, it gains powerful magic. Filling the reservoir takes a full minute, deals 4 points of Constitution damage (which can be healed normally), and imbues the reservoir with 4 charges. Charging the reservoir changes the blood to magical fluid, which does not clot or decay with time. The wearer can speak the first command word to draw 1 or more charges from the reservoir, curing 1 point of physical ability score damage per charge used. The wearer can speak the second command word to imbue herself with a great burst of physical prowess, depleting all remaining charges and gaining an inherent bonus to one physical ability score equal to twice the number of charges used. This bonus lasts until the end of the wearer's next turn. The bearer can only use the reservoir if it is held in hand or attached to a held or wielded weapon. A bearer can safely carry only one charged reservoir at a time; any others spontaneously drain their charges in 1d10 rounds, leaving only the highest-charged reservoir intact. A reservoir has no effect if not charged with the wearer's blood, and cannot be charged by bloodless creatures or those that cannot take Constitution damage.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, death knell","Cost":1000,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"Ultimate Equipment","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"1","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"faint","WeightValue":"0","PriceValue":2000,"CostValue":1000,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2176},{"Name":"Bone Razor","Aura":"faint necromancy","CL":5,"Slot":"none","Price":5000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"1 lb.","Description":"This jagged bone knife seems too thin and frail for combat but easily cuts flesh.

When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level. The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, knock","Cost":1500,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"Ultimate Equipment","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"1","AuraStrength":"moderate","WeightValue":"1","PriceValue":3000,"CostValue":1500,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2218},{"Name":"Chime Of Resounding Silence","Aura":"moderate evocation","CL":7,"Slot":"none","Price":10000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"1 lb.","Description":"This foot-long tube of gold absorbs nearby sound when struck, as if it were the target of a silence spell.

When a goblin skull bomb breaks, the very last creature to touch it bursts into a raging magical flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of fire damage and also catching fire should it fail a Reflex save (DC 13).

If the target survives the fire, doesn't have a skull, or if its skull is destroyed before another creature touches it, it does not create a new goblin skull bomb. A skull bomb can be used as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the skull shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the attacker misses, the skull breaks upon the floor or another nearby hard surface and the attacker bursts into flame. Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld items such as tools or weapons counts as touching the skull.

The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack). When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.

However, a bearer not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she makes use of its powers.

Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging through the book is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes. Once per day, the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as if from a scroll, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their magic is bound permanently within the book itself. The owner of the book need not have the book in her possession in order to use its power. The book can be stored elsewhere and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power, so long as no other creature attempts to make use of the book, in so doing becoming its owner. Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions.

Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse. The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are clarified below. Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level. Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards. Euryale: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent. The Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation. Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days. Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester. Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each. Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional. Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional. Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand. Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat. Moon: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received. Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect. Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost. Skull: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone-if others help, dread wraiths appear to fight them as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle. Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated. Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck. Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour). Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely. The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards. PLAQUE TAROT CARD PLAYING CARD SUMMARY OF EFFECT Balance XI.

When a creature holding the knucklebone of fickle fortune looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die, instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to determine the effect (see the table). For effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as #17) or a specific result is rolled (such as #14), the character is aware of this restriction. d20 RUNE NAME EFFECT 1 Eya-Doh The character gains 1 permanent negative level. 2 Bvu The character is subject to a powerful compulsion never to roll the knucklebone of fickle fortune again.

It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action. Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30. If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it.

If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does.

Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to focus the arcane rays of the device. The celestial lens was c reated to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars. Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing light focused directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the flame of guidance. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around its temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning.

This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities. • Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability. • Guards and wards 1/day on the central tower. • Storm of vengeance 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet). • Wind wall at will.

Once per day, when the bearer flips the whispering coin and asks a question in Thassilonian while the coin is in the air, the coin provides an answer to the question as it lands, either \"yes\" (the Thassilonian rune) or \"no\" (the broken column); the word \"yes\" or \"no\" is also whispered into the user's ear as the answer is determined. A whispering coin's knowledge is limited to events that have a significant chance to affect the coin's carrier in the immediate future (no further out than a few minutes), and is further limited to facts, not conjecture. You could ask a whispering coin whether a door you were about to open is trapped, but not \"Is the king the mastermind of the conspiracy we just learned about?\" The GM, in other words, can determine whether or not a whispering coin can answer or not-if the coin can't answer, it spins on its edge upon landing for several seconds before flopping over to a random side and does not whisper a \"yes\" or \"no\" into the user's ear.

This blasphemous book consists of numerous scattered chapters divided into three volumes-daemonic, demonic, and diabolic. Should all chapters of those three volumes be united in their entirety, the completed compilation exhibits the following abilities. The complete Book of the Damned radiates a permanent unhallow effect in a 150-foot radius and a sympathy effect tuned to attract all evil creatures. Any creature of good alignment that willingly touches the tome must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be immediately slain. Additionally, while the Book of the Damned is outside of its repository (see below), any evil being of demigod-level power (daemonic harbingers, demon lords, infernal dukes) or greater using scry or a similar spell can view the Book of the Damned with no risk of being detected by the bearer. Finally, any creatures that make use of any of the tome's abilities are damned, condemned to one of the Lower Planes after death regardless of their deeds. Only the intervention of a deity can prevent this punishment. The complete compilation of the Book of the Damned can be used in multiple ways-as a profane talisman, as an obscene reference volume, and as a gate to the multiverse's most complete repository of unholy lore. Talisman: As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all spells with the evil descriptor as if she were two caster levels higher and gains a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks made when interacting with evil outsiders. The bearer can also make use of the following spell-like abilities: At will-align weapon (evil only), bestow curse, detect evil, speak with dead 3/day-banishment, blasphemy, dictum, magic circle, unhallow, unholy aura, unholy blight, word of chaos 1/day-dimensional lock, gate, greater planar binding, soul bind Reference: Any character who can read Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal and who spends a total of 30 days (not necessarily contiguously) studying the tome learns soul-tainting secrets- the ultimate blasphemies of all creation. The bearer gains a +10 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks whenever she consults the book for 1 hour regarding a question. Additionally, the book's descriptions of Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell prove so vivid that any teleportation to or within those planes always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). The bearer of the Book of the Damned also gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check required by the planar binding spell (this bonus stacks with the +5 bonus the tome grants on interactions with evil outsiders). Once per day, the bearer can ask the tome a question relating to any profane topic; she then opens the book to a random page to find the answer, revealed as if the bearer had cast vision. The book also contains a copy of every spell with the evil spell descriptor. Repository: Once per day, the bearer of the Book of the Damned can cause the tome to disappear into its own internal demiplane, leaving behind a sinister shimmering portal. This reproduces the effects of a mage's magnificent mansion spell, allowing the bearer and those she chooses to enter an unnerving but semi-safe library filled with the countless volumes of blasphemous records the Book of the Damned merely serves as a window upon. The book and those within the repository are affected by a powerful nondetection effect, shielding all within from the sight of even the gods. Creatures do not age while inside, although upon leaving, they immediately age an amount equal to the time spent inside. While within the demiplane, visitors may access any of the powers described in the Reference section. Creatures of nonevil alignment find the macabre surroundings and frightening servants within the repository unsettling, and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be afflicted as if by the nightmare spell every time they attempt to rest within. Nothing can prevent this effect. The entrance to the Book of the Damned's repository can be entered by creatures other than those the bearer chooses on certain nights, specifically during lunar eclipses and the midnight hour on the night of a new moon, during which time the barely visible portal manifests as a normal door.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Artifacts & Legends","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The Book of the Damned must be divided into its varied chapters and each must be destroyed separately within the span of 1 day.

The lifelike legs aren't the only thing that make the hut remarkable, though. The small building's only door opens into a room more than twice the size of what the structure could naturally contain, but this remarkable space is but a threshold to places more wondrous still, for it is merely one possible configuration of countless extradimensional rooms (see page 23 for a map of this \"default\" layout of the hut's interior). Nothing that transpires outside the hut has any effect on those inside. The properties and abilities of the Dancing Hut are divided into two categories, the defensive and the transportive. Defensive: At its most basic level, the Dancing Hut is a unique CR 17 construct. The statistics and abilities of this remarkable creation are detailed on the following pages. A creature inside the hut can command the structure to move, attack, use its special abilities, or immediately perform any other function it is capable of by employing the Dancing Hut's unusual controls, which consist of a brown hen's egg inside a simple, cracked clay bowl sitting upon a table inside the hut. Both the bowl and egg can easily be removed or destroyed, but both reappear 1 hour later and only function within the confines of the hut. Breaking the egg reveals the head of live and very irate rooster that dies a long, squawking death-and disappears an hour later when the controls reform. Any creature that makes a successful DC 30 Use Magic Device check can use these innocuous controls to command the Dancing Hut. Failing this check causes the hut to dance erratically, potentially trampling creatures nearby, but has no effect on creatures inside the hut. A creature must succeed at a new Use Magic Device check every round to directly control the hut's actions. The hut can be assigned simple, standing commands to follow, such as to attack any humanoid that approaches, to patrol an area, to head in a direction for a set period, or to flee if damaged, but nothing complicated that requires it to follow multipart instructions, recognize specific individuals, or seek a specific place. Transportive: As a construct, the Dancing Hut can physically move on its own, but it also possesses the ability to slip between planes and even travel to other planets, carrying any inside the hut with it. This remarkable ability is activated using the cauldron within the hut, which links the hut to countless-if not infinite-locations across the planes. To use these transportive abilities, a creature must stand before the hut's cauldron, place two ingredients inside, and stir the everbubbling stew within-a process requiring a full-round action, though finding the desired ingredients might take longer. The two ingredients act as \"keys\" to a specific destination. Each destination the hut can travel to has a specific combination, or \"recipe,\" of two keys, which appear to be relatively normal items stored throughout the hut itself. Although the keys appear to be absolutely mundane, only those specific items within the hut function as keys. So while a red apple might be one key, it must be the red apple found inside the Dancing Hut, not just any apple. Like the hut's controls, keys can easily be destroyed or removed from the hut, but they reappear 1 hour later. Once the proper keys have been placed in the cauldron, the Dancing Hut immediately appears at its new destination, as if it had traveled there via plane shift or interplanetary teleport (The Inner Sea World Guide). The hut always appears in the same location at a given destination-the keys are tied to that specific location at the destination. Once at a destination, the Dancing Hut can move (or be moved) to any other location on that world or plane normally. Once the hut arrives at its new destination, the keys immediately disappear from the cauldron, reforming elsewhere in the hut. Each time a new combination of keys is used to transport the Dancing Hut to a new location, the interior layout of the hut changes, as each location the hut can travel to has its own corresponding layout of the hut's interior. The map on page 23 depicts a sample layout for the hut's interior, but as the hut travels, this layout can change dramatically, though every layout contains one room with a cauldron and the hut's controls, regardless of how many rooms are present in that layout. When the hut's layout changes, the other layouts still exist, and are inaccessible from within the hut itself. Magic such as plane shift can still be used to visit these otherwise inaccessible layouts, and Baba Yaga herself (and perhaps some other residents of the hut as well) can freely travel throughout all of the rooms of the hut, regardless of the hut's physical location. The table above presents a list of some of the best-known destinations the hut can travel to, along with the two keys needed to take the hut to that location. This list is by no means all-inclusive, and none-save perhaps Baba Yaga herself-know the limits of the hut's transportive properties.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Artifacts & Legends","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"If the cauldron inside the Dancing Hut is used to open a gate within the cauldron itself, a rift in reality opens, destroying the hut's extradimensional interior and sucking in the exterior frame-likely destroying whoever activated the cauldron, and some posit much more than that.

A bearer of a Harrow Deck of Many Things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards he will draw before doing so. These cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw any more cards from the deck than he announced (unless the effect of a drawn card states otherwise). If the character does not willingly draw his allotted number or is somehow prevented from doing so, the cards flip out of the deck on their own after 1 hour.

When first given to a creature, the necklace recognizes members of the creature's race and gender-but not a specific individual- as its owner. The owner automatically fails any saving throw made to resist the effects of divination magic, but the necklace seeks to protect the owner against danger, reactively casting spells to defend its wearer against effects that compromise her control. The spells the amulet can cast (and when it does so) include freedom (in response to imprisonment, petrification, paralysis, and similar effects described by this spell), greater dispel magic (in response to any fear or mind-affecting effect), remove curse (in response to curses), protection from chaos (in response to any form of possession or similar control). The wearer has no control over when these spells are cast and the target of these spells is always the wearer. The Invidian Eye can cast each spell 3 times per day. If the Invidian Eye is worn by a creature not of the race and gender it recognizes as its owner, it ceases to use its defensive properties. In addition, once every 1d6 days, the gem makes a self-destructive suggestion. The wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or make a casual attempt to harm herself during the course of the day. This suggestion does not dominate the wearer's actions, but she might be compelled to cut herself if she's wielding a weapon or jump if she passes a high window. If the wearer resists this compulsion three times in a row, the Invidian Eye takes more serious measures, conjuring a miniature prismatic sphere into the wearer's throat, which causes the wearer to begin suffocating (Core Rulebook 445). The sphere can only be removed by targeting the wearer with the same spells that normally remove a full size prismatic wall. The race and gender the Invidian Eye perceives as its owner can be reset by casting mage's disjunction upon the artifact, though this carries the normal risk of destroying the artifact. Whoever the necklace is next given to determines the artifact's new owner. The Invidian Eye is under the effects of a permanent nondetection spell.

The magic circle varies in radius, but can hold one outsider called into its space by the spell planar binding, regardless of its size. While the lens improves the effectiveness of the spell planar binding, it does not actually cast the spell, requiring some outside agency to cast the spell while employing the lens as an additional focus component. The target of the planar binding receives its normal Will save to resist, but once it appears within the lens's magic circle, it cannot escape-the lens prevents the outsider from using its spell resistance or Charisma to escape, and locks it in place as per the spell dimensional anchor. Once trapped within the lens's magic circle, an outsider is trapped indefinitely, until it agrees to the user's demands or a sentient creature touches the prison with intent to free the outsider-doing so releases the outsider immediately. Even rolls of 1 on Charisma checks to coerce the outsider into service do not free the outsider. While the lens does not grant the user a bonus on Charisma checks made to influence creatures trapped within its prison, it does grant the user an additional use for the outsider: The outsider can be bound within the lens, transforming the artifact into an arcane engine of sorts. The user must compel the outsider to submit to this service, as described by the spell planar binding. The outsider receives a +10 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to resist entering into service. This bonus is reduced by 1 for every week the outsider remains bound (minimum 0). The lens can only hold one outsider at a time, and it cannot employ its magic circle effect while an outsider is trapped within. If an outsider agrees to be bound into the lens, it becomes trapped inside the lens and cannot free itself. While bearing the lens, the wielder can employ any of the outsider's spell-like abilities. How often the wielder can use these spell-like abilities is limited by the outsider's Hit Dice and the frequency with which the imprisoned outsider can normally use its spell-like abilities. The outsider's Hit Dice become a pool of soul points the wielder has access to, with each Hit Die equating to 1 soul point. The lens's bearer can employ the imprisoned outsider's spell-like abilities by spending a number of soul points equal to the spell-like ability's spell level. If the lens no longer has enough soul points to pay for a spell-like ability's use, the ability cannot be used. If the imprisoned outsider can only use a spell-like ability a certain number of times in an amount of time, the wielder cannot employ that spell-like ability more than that number of times in the amount of time specified, even if the lens has enough soul points to pay for the ability's use. The lens's total number of soul points replenishes every day. The outsider within the lens can be freed by spending 1 soul point. The released outsider is exhausted, but is not controlled by the lens's bearer. The outsider within the lens can also communicate telepathically with a creature touching the artifact, though it exerts no control over the bearer.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Artifacts & Legends","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The Lens of Galundari can only be destroyed if a deity is freed from within.

While there is a soul trapped within the sword, the Bound Blade emanates the effects of the spell desecrate in a 50-foot-radius aura. This aura lasts for a number of days equal to the number of Hit Dice the slain creature possessed. After that period passes, the soul within the sword is destroyed and cannot be restored by any method short of divine intervention. The sword wielder can release a trapped soul by using the blade's soul bind ability on another creature.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Artifacts & Legends","AL":"LE","Int":10,"Wis":"10","Cha":12,"Ego":"10","Communication":"empathy","Senses":"30 ft.","Powers":"constant- deathwatch 3/day-deeper darkness, rage, slow (DC 14)","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The Bound Blade shatters if used by a paladin of Abadar to slay a fallen paladin dedicated to Zon-Kuthon.","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"1","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"1","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"6","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"+3 unholy adamantine bastard sword","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2478},{"Name":"Crown Of Fangs","Aura":"strong enchantment, illusion, necromancy","CL":20,"Slot":"head","Weight":"4 lbs.","Description":"Kazavon's teeth were set into a jeweled circlet of gold, creating the Crown of Fangs.

Each day at sunrise, the gem rotates to display a different facet. The active facet determines the ring's power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 on the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table to determine which facet-and thus which power-is active. The wearer of the ring can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one she does not desire. The gem can only be turned in a particular order that shifts the active facet to the next highest facet, and each facet is a particular number of steps away from one another (see the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table). To change the facet, the wearer must succeed at a Wisdom check as a full-round action, and the wearer takes nonlethal damage, regardless of success. The DC of the Wisdom check to turn the gem is 15 + 5 per 1-step increase, while the nonlethal damage dealt equals 1d6 per 1-step increase. For example, if the facet of the day were yellow, the wearer could attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check and take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to copper, or attempt a DC 25 Wisdom check and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to green. The ring's facets cannot be shifted backwards (thus, yellow cannot turn directly to white; it must shift through all seven other colors to reach white). The ring's facet can only be changed once per day. Any nongood creature that wears the Ring of Nine Facets immediately takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and another 2d6 points of nonlethal damage every minute it continues to wear the ring. 1d10/Step Facet Color Active Facet Power 1 Green Wearer is immune to disease 2 Indigo Wearer needs no air to survive 3 Orange Wearer gains a +5 natural armor bonus 4 Violet Wearer gains low-light vision 5 Red Wearer gains fast healing 1 6 Blue Wearer can use fly at will 7 White Wearer gains cold resistance 30 8 Yellow Wearer gains freedom of movement 9 Copper Wearer gains a +5 resistance bonus on saving throws 10* Roll again. * This step does not count as a facet for the purposes of adjusting the ring's daily ability.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Artifacts & Legends","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"If the wearer of the Ring of Nine Facets successfully shifts it through all nine facets twice (requiring a DC 105 Wisdom check and incurring 18d6 points of nonlethal damage) a tenth, black facet is revealed.

In addition to the damage this weapon deals, any creature struck by the scepter ages a number of years equal to the damage taken. On a critical hit, not only does the scepter deal greater damage, but the victim ages 2 years for every point of damage taken. Creatures aged in this manner might have their physical ability scores reduced; consult Table 7-2 on page 169 of the Core Rulebook for the effects of aging on common humanoids. For the wide range of unlisted humanoids and non-humanoids this aging might affect, GMs should use their judgment, general knowledge, and creature descriptions to decide how the effects of aging apply on a race-by-race basis. GMs looking for a quick way to approximate the ages of minor opponents should alter Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution by -1 for every 10 years aged and consider +40 years to be a creature's maximum age. Any creature aged to greater than its maximum age immediately dies. Constructs, outsiders, and undead are immune to the effects of aging. The mental abilities of those affected by this form of aging do not increase. Creatures that gain abilities dependant on their age gain these abilities as normal (though, at the GM's discretion, these abilities might not be immediately usable). The spell regenerate restores 1 year of premature aging for every hit point it heals. Creatures killed by aging can only be restored by true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but even these spells do not heal aging, returning the target to life only 1 year younger than his maximum age. In addition to its use as a weapon, the Scepter of Ages can open a portal through time. To do this, the scepter's bearer must spend 10 minutes precisely aligning the delicate mechanisms within the artifact's head to the exact dates she wishes to travel to. This requires the bearer to make either a DC 30 Knowledge (history) check to program a precise date or a DC 30 Wisdom check to travel to a general period. The bearer can rush through calibrating the scepter, activating it in 1 minute, but doing so increases the associated DCs by +10. Regardless of whether or not this check is successful, a 5-foot-wide glowing tear in time opens within 15 feet. This rift cannot be used as a weapon or to destructive effect. What time the passage opens to is determined by whether the bearer succeeds at the check (opening a portal to the desired time) or fails (opening a portal to the incorrect time, determined by how significantly he failed, as shown on the Accidental Time Travel Results table on page 43). The time beyond the portal cannot be viewed and can only be discovered by passing completely through. The rift remains open for 1 minute before closing. What creatures or conditions lie beyond the portal are determined by the GM (see the Ages of Golarion table on page 43 for examples of different times on Golarion).","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Artifacts & Legends","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"Adhering to laws beyond those of this reality, The Scepter of Ages cannot be destroyed, only carried to a time beyond the reach of modern users.

Once per day, the bearer can invoke a form of fire shield that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage similarly to the spell flame strike. Once per round as an immediate action, if an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, the bearer can use the shield to redirect the attack to himself, taking all effects from that attack as if he were the intended target. All allies within 100 feet of the bearer gain the effect of bless and prayer. Additionally, all allies within 100 feet of the bearer know his relative position and condition, as per the spell status. Beyond these properties, the Shield of Aroden is designed to protect its bearer from death. Any attack that would kill the bearer (not merely make him unconscious or dying) triggers this ability, redirecting the lethal attack fully upon the shield and leaving the bearer unharmed (even if the attack normally only works on living creatures). For example, if the bearer failed a saving throw against flesh to stone, the shield would turn to stone and shatter instead, whereas if the bearer failed his save against horrid wilting, the shield would turn to dry splinters. This power always destroys the shield, reducing it to 1d20 nearly invulnerable shards that suggest the way in which it was last destroyed. The Shield of Aroden bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the shield is held or carried.

Possession of the skull grants several abilities.

These grim statuettes appear as skull-topped fortresses the size of a clenched fist. When activated by speaking a command word, a bone house grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement on top. The bone walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress-even knock spells can't open the door. The bone walls are magically enhanced to be as hard as stone, and have 100 hit points and hardness 10. A bone house can be repaired by casting inflict spells on the walls, with every 10 points of negative energy repairing 1 point of damage. A bone house springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone caught in the area takes 10d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half damage). The interior of a bone house is under the constant effects of a desecrate spell and is considered an altar to Zon-Kuthon for the purposes of determining the desecrate modifiers. Once a bone house is expanded into tower size, its owner can create up to four mummies per month from the drifts of bone ash and detritus that litter the inner rooms. Creating a mummy in this manner takes 10 minutes, and the owner must be inside of the bone house the entire time. Due to the desecrate effect, mummies created inside gain +2 hit points per Hit Die. These undead guard the contents of the bone house without needing to be commanded. If the owner wishes to command these mummies to perform other tasks, he must use other means to do so.

The painting is a powerful minor artifact that can be used to create one or more duplicates of any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 10. By touching the painting and uttering a command word, the subject creature is drawn into the painting and appears seated in the chair. The subject is under the effects of a binding spell. Delving into the subconscious mind, the painting creates a duplicate of the subject that lasts for 1 day per Hit Die the creature possesses. If the subject creature has a positive Charisma modifier, additional duplicates equal to its Charisma modifier may be created. Each of these duplicates represents an alter ego of the subject. Some beings may have multiple alter egos. In this case, the subject creature determines exactly how many id duplicates he wants the id portrait to create, up to a maximum determined by his Charisma modifier.

Those affected by a parasitic soul have their own personality and sanity overwhelmed by the remnant ambitions and memories of the would-be lich whose destruction created the phylactery.

The cursed creature cannot be returned to life until the lich is destroyed. If the parasitic soul is excised from a victim, it returns to the phylactery and attempts to infect the next creature to open the box. The parasitic soul can only infect one creature at a time. While a creature is infected by a parasitic soul, the phylactery the soul is bound to has no dangerous properties and cannot infect other creatures. The invasive nature of phylacteries of the failed has spawned the creation of several other pernicious magic items, such as the disease-spreading death's head coffer (see Pathfinder Adventure Path #8).

Each is an intelligent artifact largely in control of itself. A totem radiates an aura that forces all non-worshipers of Angazhan within 30 feet to make a successful DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A totem can also make use of its own spell-like abilities as it pleases, frequently lashing out with weird to attack. Its size and direct connection to Angazhan's power prevents it from easily being used by other creatures. Any who would employ its powers must touch the totem. Those who aren't chaotic evil worshipers of Angazhan must also enter into a contest of wills with the totem to make use of its powers for that day (see page 535 of the Core Rulebook). If a creature wins the contest, that creature can direct the totem to use its abilities. Additionally, the creature is immune to the totem's panic aura for 24 hours and the totem cannot use its spell-like abilities against the creature for that day. Once per day, a totem of Angazhan can reincarnate a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the reincarnated creature always returns to life as a chaotic evil charau-ka (The Inner Sea World Guide). A creature reincarnated as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con. Once per year, the totem may instead use its reincarnate ability to bring a creature back to life as a chaotic evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature reincarnated as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con. When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor rules as the Gorilla King for another year. As with all reincarnate effects, the creature being restored to life must be willing for the effect to work-the creature to be reincarnated knows that accepting the offer to come back to life enslaves its soul to Angazhan (resulting in the shift to chaotic evil and the drive to seek out and replace the current Gorilla King). If a totem of Angazhan is placed upon or adjacent to an altar of Angazhan that is under the effect of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Angazhan, the totem of Angazhan's sensory range extends to 300 feet, and it can use its abilities in this extended range as long as it has line of sight to its target.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Artifacts & Legends","AL":"CE","Int":7,"Wis":"14","Cha":13,"Ego":"18","Communication":"empathy","Senses":"30 ft. hearing and tremorsense, true seeing","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"A totem of Angazhan can be destroyed only by a Gorilla King (either acting on his own volition or while under the effects of magical control), who can damage the totem as if it were a normal item with hardness 8 and 100 hit points (or by succeeding at a DC 30 Strength check to break the totem in half ). Of course, once a Gorilla King makes his first attack upon one of these totems, the blasphemy against Angazhan causes that Gorilla King to no longer count as a worshiper of Angazhan, and he can now be affected by the totem's panic aura. Worse, the affront allows the totem of Angazhan to attempt once per round to revoke that Gorilla King's reincarnated body. Each round the blasphemous Gorilla King remains within reach of the totem's senses, the Gorilla King must make a successful DC 25 Fortitude save to avoid being transformed back into whatever race the creature was before he was reincarnated. Once this occurs, the target is no longer a Gorilla King and can no longer damage the totem, but the totem can continue to use weird to attempt to slay the creature as long as it is able.","MinorArtifactFlag":"1","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"1","Transmutation":"1","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"150","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2513},{"Name":"Vernal Key","Aura":"strong transmutation","CL":20,"Slot":"none","Weight":"5 lbs.","Description":"The Vernal Key consists of three lattice orbs, one inside the other, all carved from a single piece of blue mineral.

The first rod of this type was created by a ruthless cabal of wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their most promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake of greater power. The bound apprentices' intellects have no free will but retain their rebellious imaginations. Under normal circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands, but it can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how unhappy it is to be a group of living minds imprisoned in an inanimate object-though few wielders care. While no good creature would create a metamagician's apprentice, he or she can still wield one. The rod can be used as a +1 light mace. On command, it transforms into a +1/+1 quarterstaff or back to its rod form. A metamagician's apprentice knows four metamagic feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two levels higher than the spell's actual level, such as Silent Spell and Empower Spell) and acts as a greater metamagic rod for those feats. The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a metamagic rod) the wielder can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell. The rod can use read magic and detect magic at will. The metamagician's apprentice is never overwhelmed by powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading to activate (such as the explosive runes spell). The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on three Knowledge skills; these skills are determined when the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and can never be changed. Knowledge (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills. A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments exist. If a metamagician's apprentice becomes dominant after a personality conflict, it insists the wearer find a way to free its mind from the object or destroy the item so its mind can be at peace.","Requirements":"Craft Rod, the four metamagic feats the rod is to know","Cost":47105,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Rod","Source":"Ultimate Equipment","AL":"lawful neutral","Int":18,"Wis":"14","Cha":10,"Ego":"20","Communication":"","Senses":"120 ft.","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"1","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"5","PriceValue":93605,"CostValue":47105,"Languages":"telepathy (Common and eight other languages)","BaseItem":"+1 light mace|+1/+1 quarterstaff","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2600},{"Name":"Obsession Ring","Aura":"moderate abjuration","CL":9,"Slot":"ring","Price":116500,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"-","Description":"These rings of protection +3 are extremely varied in form.

Each slave collar's lock is attuned to a unique key. The person who carries a collar's key is aware of that collar's wearer as if it were the target of a constant status spell. In addition, the key carrier can communicate telepathically with the wearer of the collar as long as the wearer is within 100 feet of her.

But when Xin used it as an element in the clockwork reliquary's construction, the key's powers were vastly diminished.

The diminished key can be recovered from the destroyed reliquary's remains.

Clockworks wound by the guardian key are healed of 5d8+20 points of damage, remain active for 10 times longer than they normally would, and during this period gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The guardian key can also be used to seize control of a clockwork. To do so, a creature must attempt a touch attack against the target clockwork as a standard action. If it hits, the clockwork can attempt a DC 15 Will save to resist.

Xin created the Sihedron as more than just a symbol of his power over the schools of magic he'd defined for his nation, though. It was initially meant to be a badge of his power over all of Thassilon, and a symbol of the unified nature of the nation's peoples. Each of the Sihedron's arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the nation of Thassilon was made of different races-Azlanti, Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than merely making the Sihedron a symbol of harmony and diversity, though, and built into its functionality significant advantages when the artifact is shared among a number of allies. The powers granted by the Sihedron are greatest when it is used not by a lone individual, but by a group that works together toward a common goal, and whose members trust each other enough to effortlessly pass control of the powerful item between themselves swiftly and without a second thought. Alas, Xin's ideals for the diversity of Thassilon were misplaced, and even as his rule continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid and unwilling to share the powers granted by the Sihedron. The fact that the item was intended to be a powerful shared artifact but has never properly been used in this manner is one of the greatest ironies of Thassilon. The Sihedron itself is a relatively plain-looking item. The seven different hues of its composite metals help to give it some color, but the artifact lacks any of the decorative runes and markings that are so common on other Thassilonian artifacts. Even the artifact itself, built in the image of the sign of Lissala and the rune for the Thassilonian schools of magic, seems somewhat plain, lacking the Sihedron rune's distinctive hooklike shapes along its arms. In fact, these hooks are represented in the device by the placement of the seven ioun stone receptacles. Once the Sihedron is activated, it glows with a warm yellow light that sheds illumination as if via a daylight spell. To activate the Sihedron, a person need only touch the center of the star where all seven arms meet and concentrate as a swift action-the Sihedron immediately rises up into the air behind the user's head like a halo and floats along behind him wherever he goes, even teleporting along with him. Although the Sihedron is not in physical contact with the user, it is in all ways treated as if it were an attended object being held or carried. The Sihedron implants knowledge of all its powers and how to activate them into the mind of anyone who activates it in this way. Once activated, the Sihedron protects its user in a number of ways. First, it constantly infuses the wearer with magical energy, granting him fast healing 5. Second, it grants the user the constant effects of a foresight spell (providing a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and preventing the user from ever being surprised or flat-footed). Third, up to once per day, the Sihedron can target its wearer with true resurrection the instant he is slain-he need not activate this power, as the Sihedron automatically triggers if the user is killed. When the user activates the Sihedron, he may select one of the star's points to be \"ascendant.\" The Sihedron rotates so that this point is pointing upward, and he immediately gains an additional defense and the use of a spell-like ability, usable at will, as detailed below. The user may change which point is ascendant as a standard action by concentrating, but cannot change the point to an \"oppositional\" point. The effects granted by each of the Sihedron's points (as well as the two oppositional points for each) are listed at the end of this item description. As an immediate action (but no more often than once during any single combat round), the current user of the Sihedron may cause the artifact to instantaneously transfer itself to another willing creature within 120 feet. The Sihedron teleports from the current user and appears behind the head of the target creature. As it does so, it unleashes a surge of potent magic that affects both of these creatures, granting a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws for 1 round and healing each creature of 2d8+10 points of damage. This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but it must be made before the result of that role is confirmed by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature actually takes damage from any source, which could heal a heavily wounded target before the additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it. When the Sihedron is granted to a new target in this manner, the new target can automatically select which point of the Sihedron is ascendant, even if the point selected is oppositional to the previously active point. Each of the Sihedron's arms contains an ioun stone embedded in a small receptacle. These ioun stones cannot be removed as long as the Sihedron is whole, and they help to power the following additional abilities when one of the points is ascendant. Charity: Grants a +4 insight bonus to AC and dimensional anchor as a spell-like ability. Opposed by kindness and temperance. Generosity: Grants a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls and beast shape II as a spell-like ability. Opposed by humility and love. Humility: Grants a +8 insight bonus on skill checks and greater invisibility as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and zeal.

A crude wooden spoon serves a bookmark. A cookbook of arcane augmentation contains recipes that allow an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells to augment her spells with specific metamagic effects through ritual preparation. A cookbook of arcane augmentation contains recipes for Ectoplasmic SpellAPG, Persistent SpellAPG, Rime SpellUM, and Sickening SpellAPG, and can be used to augment spells of 6th level or lower. Once per day, the spellcaster can augment a spell by following a recipe as part of her normal spell preparation. To prepare an augmented spell, the spellcaster must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 15 + spell level) while mixing the recipe's ingredients in a cauldron. (The cost of these ingredients is negligible, and they are assumed to be readily available in a spell component pouch.) If the check succeeds, the spell is augmented with the recipe's metamagic feat. This doesn't change the spell slot of the augmented spell. On a failed check, that spell can't be augmented that day, but the caster can attempt to augment another spell. A spellcaster can prepare only a single augmented spell each time she prepares spells, and apply only one augmentation from the cookbook to any given spell, but can combine an augmentation with metamagic feats she possesses. In this case, only the feats possessed by the caster adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. The book doesn't confer the associated metamagic feat on the owner, only the ability to use the given feat when spells are prepared.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, Ectoplasmic SpellAPG, Persistent SpellAPG, Rime SpellUM, Sickening SpellAPG","Cost":10750,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"AP 69","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"5","PriceValue":21500,"CostValue":10750,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2690},{"Name":"Frost-Thunder Hammer","Aura":"moderate evocation","CL":9,"Slot":"none","Price":24524,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"10 lbs.","Description":"This oversized +2 warhammer is forged from blue steel and engraved with Abyssal runes that read, \"There are no screams for those who die the frozen death.\" A frost-thunder hammer is sized for giants; it is a two-handed weapon for Medium-sized creatures, who take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for wielding an oversized weapon.

This ability cannot be used if the weapon is destroyed. Once per day on command, the wielder can transform a rimeblade into a beam of ice-cold flame called rimefire. The weapon is still wielded as scimitar, and attacks with the blade-like beam are melee touch attacks that deal 1d8+3 points of cold damage (regardless of the wielder's size). Because the beam is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier doesn't apply to damage. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from the rimefire beam is covered in clinging frost and is entangled for 1 round. The rimefire beam lasts for 1 minute, after which the weapon returns to its normal form. In addition, once per day as a swift action before an attack, a rimeblade's wielder can cause the blade to glow with a pale blue radiance. On a successful attack, the rimeblade deals an additional 4d6 points of cold damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute instead.

The pages pertaining to the good Outer Planes lie within covers of beaten precious metals, bedecked with jewels of every color and inscribed with celestial iconography. Only a truly reverent individual, completely devoted to good, can open the Chronicle of the Righteous without an effort of will; for others, a successful DC 12 Will save is required to open the book. On a failed save, the individual decides she is unworthy of beholding the Chronicle and cannot attempt to open the book again for 24 hours. The Chronicle of the Righteous is written in Celestial. It details the geography of the good-aligned planes, the gods, empyreal lords, and celestial creatures who live there, and the unadulterated truths of these beings and their acts-truths that are sometimes heartening and at other times unsettling. Any evil-aligned creature who touches the Chronicle of the Righteous gains 1 negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Nongood creatures attempting to read the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward good. A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every conjuration (healing) spell and every spell with the good descriptor. The user gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least 1 hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the good-aligned planes are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within those planes always brings the caster to the exact location desired. As long as the book is carried, the user is immediately aware of any action that might cause an alignment shift or a loss of standing with her deity, as if she wore a phylactery of faithfulness. The Chronicle of the Righteous is also surrounded by a permanent zone of truth, and creatures must succeed at a DC 15 Will save to tell a lie within 20 feet of the book. The bearer of the book casts all good spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with good creatures. Three times per day, the book can be used to cast one of the following spells: banishment, consecrate, greater planar binding, holy smite, holy word, sanctify weapons, and summon monster VII. Each time the Chronicle of the Righteous is referenced or used to cast a spell, there is a 10% chance that any empyreal lords on the same plane as the user instantly become aware of the book's precise location.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Chronicle Of The Righteous","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The Chronicle of the Righteous can be destroyed by first bathing it in the blood of a fallen empyreal lord who has killed at least 100 good mortals and then burning it in a pit of hellfire.","MinorArtifactFlag":"1","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"none","WeightValue":"12","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2712},{"Name":"Empyreal Armor","Aura":"strong evocation [fire]","CL":13,"Slot":"armor","Price":100050,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"50 lbs.","Description":"Legend tells that the first suits of empyreal armor were forged from the battered, cast-off breastplates worn by solars in battle.

Once a gas-trap cylinder is activated, it remains so for 10 minutes, and any creature composed primarily of air, fog, mist, or other vapor (including air elementals, hungry fogs, mihstus, trench mists, vampiric mists, and creatures in gaseous form) within 30 feet of the cylinder must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be sucked into the device, becoming trapped within.

Releasing creatures trapped in a gas-trap cylinder follows the same process as arming the cylinder. Arming the device requires a standard action, and the trapped creatures are released 1 round later.

The sound from this effect easily travels 60 feet, as the audible alarm version of the alarm spell. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the wielder and assigned to the wayfinder before she falls asleep) does not set off the alarm. When the wayfinder's alarm is triggered, the violent motion of the noisemaker wayfinder continues until the wielder presses a button on the side of the device. If the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder is affected by a magical sleep effect (such as that caused by a sleep spell) and the alarm is triggered, the constant buzzing and vibration of the wayfinder allows the wielder to attempt a saving throw each round at the end of her turn to end the sleep effect and gives her a +2 circumstance bonus on such saves.

(A typical blank, 50-page journal costs 10 gp.) Once per day, when another book, folio, scroll, or other text is placed within the satchel while a blank book is hidden within the extradimensional space, the pages of the newly added book are wiped blank (though the covers and bindings remain unchanged). The entire contents of this book or scroll appear on the pages of the blank book in the satchel's extradimensional pocket. The transfer takes 1 full round, and if the process is interrupted, such as by either book being removed or the satchel being significantly damaged, the text being copied is lost forever. If the blank book is smaller in size (in number of pages for a book or number of inches for a scroll) than the book to be stolen, the satchel doesn't transfer the contents, and the text being copied is lost forever. A book thief's satchel can't transfer magical writing (such as the pages of a wizard's spellbook, a magical scroll, or a wondrous item).

Her accusations cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened to excommunicate her. Instead, she said she would enter the Worldwound and fight the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword Radiance for company. The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 ar, leading a small army of crusaders she'd rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed. For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed to return to Kenabres with Radiance, but Yaniel's body had been taken. The sword had gone dark after Yaniel's death, its magical powers apparently lost, and so the crusaders elected to place it in the Gray Garrison on display. Yet several months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil. Radiance was once a powerful weapon, yet since Yaniel's death the blade has become inert. When handled by a paladin, however, the blade suddenly glows with golden light and functions as a +1 cold iron longsword that radiates light as a torch on command. The weapon shifts and changes its form to match the paladin's deity's favored weapon (in the hands of a paladin who doesn't worship a deity, the weapon remains a +1 longsword). Certain events and tasks can awaken Radiance's latent powers, eventually transforming it into a full-fledged holy avenger-these events are noted in the following adventures in Wrath of the Righteous as they occur. In addition, Radiance is a legendary item (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 169) that bonds with a mythic paladin a s soon as it is wielded in combat-in this adventure, Radiance bonds if a paladin uses it in the final encounter against Vorlesh's babaus. The weapon has two daily uses of legendary power that recharge each day, but does not currently possess any legendary attributes, for it has yet to be wielded by a mythic paladin. As Radiance has its own ability to grow in power, it cannot be given the upgradable legendary item ability.","Requirements":"","Group":"Legendary Weapon","Source":"AP 73","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"A paladin must knowingly slay an angel with the blade, at which point the sword can be destroyed normally with damage.","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"1","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"4","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"+1 longsword|+1 cold iron longsword","Mythic":"1","LegendaryWeapon":"1","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2805},{"Name":"Terendelev's Scales","Aura":"strong (varies)","CL":19,"Slot":"none","Weight":"-","Description":"These palm-sized silver dragon scales are unique items-essentially minor artifacts resulting from Terendelev's death on the Storm King's blade.

A bastion banner emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion whose holy symbol graces the banner. Within the 40-foot radius of its hallow effect, a planted bastion banner secures terrain that would otherwise be unstable, whether due to natural causes (such as a mudslide) or supernatural causes (such as a specific plane's morphic trait). Natural terrain is simply fixed in its current configuration and cannot be altered naturally or magically; a spellcaster attempting to change the terrain affected by a bastion banner (such as with move earth or transmute mud to rock) must make a successful DC 21 caster level check to do so. Unnaturally or magically morphic terrain (such as that on the Abyss) is shaped into a 40-foot sphere with the topmost hemispherical half composed of breathable air and the lower hemispherical half composed of packed earth. This effect only secures basic footing against collapse; it cannot impede moving objects from outside the area (such as rain or an avalanche) or forces that act physically on the soil (such as shovels or tunneling creatures). When planted, a bastion banner also has a specific spell tied to the hallow effect, as well as an additional effect, both tied to the holy symbol it bears. When a bastion banner affects allies, the allies must worship the same deity as the one portrayed on the banner to benefit from the deity-specific spell and effect, and only as long as they are within 40 feet of the banner. Enemies must also be within 40 feet of the banner to be affected. The spells and effects associated with each deity are: Abadar: Protection from energy (type is set when banner is planted; renews daily); allies gain a +4 sacred bonus on checks to aid another. Asmodeus: Cause fear (affects enemies only), and the hallow effect is unhallow instead; allies gain a +2 morale bonus on combat maneuver checks. Cayden Cailean: Remove fear; whenever allies successfully resist a fear effect, they gain 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour. Desna: Freedom of movement; once per day, whenever the banner's owner or an ally rolls a d20, the owner of the banner may choose to treat the roll as a natural 20. Erastil: Invisibility purge; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with ranged weapons. Iomedae: Death ward; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with melee weapons. Irori: Resist energy (type is set when banner is planted); allies gain a +2 sacred bonus on saves.

During this time, the dagger of repossession is typically given to an ally of the creature whose blood is imprinted. If the original wielder becomes possessed (such as by a ghost's malevolence ability or a magic jar spell) and she's slashed with the dagger again, the imprinted blood is consumed, the target regains her memories, and any possession effect immediately ends. A dagger of repossession does not end charm or compulsion effects, but the target receives another save against these effects at the original DC. Other mind-affecting effects are unaffected by the dagger.

Generally, a creature with both legs affected by deadlimb pins can only crawl to move, and a creature with both arms affected is unable to attack (unless they can make attacks with other body parts, of course). The exact consequences of applying multiple doses of deadlimb pins to creatures with inhuman anatomies or unusual limbs are left to the GM's discretion.

After 24 hours adhering to one or more vows, the wearer gains additional benefits from the robe. • 1 vow: +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws, +1 competence bonus on all skill checks • 2 vows: +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws, +4 armor bonus to AC • 3 vows: +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws, +2 competence bonus on all skill checks • 4 vows: +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws, +6 armor bonus to AC • 5 vows: +8 armor bonus to AC, and all save DCs for the wearer's spells increase by 1 The wearer receives the bonuses from lower levels as well. For example, with 3 vows, the wearer receives a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws, a +2 competence bonus on all skill checks, and a +4 armor bonus to AC. The armor bonus provided by the robe can be further improved by magic vestment and similar spells. The wearer can select from the following vows. • Abstain from consuming meat and touching dead creatures. • Abstain from consuming liquor, drugs, and similar substances, including any magic item that takes effect through eating or drinking. • Carry nothing made of metal. • Refrain from dealing lethal damage. • Refrain from speaking. • Refrain from touching others, including touching them with or through clothing. • Speak and write only the truth. If a vow is broken, the robe's benefits immediately drop to those granted by the number of vows still kept. Broken vows can be regained only by way of an atonement spell.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, magic vestment, prayer, resistance","Cost":47500,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"Mythic Adventures","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"1","PriceValue":95000,"CostValue":47500,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"1","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2903},{"Name":"Phoenix Cloak","Aura":"moderate transmutation","CL":9,"Slot":"shoulders","Price":55000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"7 lbs.","Description":"This cloak is made of tough leather, and is decorated with brilliant red and orange feathers.

The hermetic flask and its creations function for only users with the alchemy class feature (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 26) and the ability to make extracts. Using the flask normally requires an alchemist's lab or crafting kit. Makeshift tools can be used, but result in a -5 penalty on all checks. If a user spends 10 minutes and 100 gp, and succeeds at a DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check, the flask can distill one dose of alchemical essence. If the user expends one use of mythic power during the distilling process, 10 doses are made instead. Alchemical essence remains stable only as long as it's contained within the hermetic flask. As a standard action, an alchemist can pour forth a dose and immediately convert it into an alchemical item worth 100 gp or less, or into a poison worth 1,000 gp or less. He may throw it or apply it as part of the same standard action. A weapon-like liquid, such as alchemist's fire, congeals into a fragile globule and remains stable until thrown or otherwise broken. Any such substance poured from the flask remains stable for 1 minute, and then dissolves harmlessly. The purity of the alchemical essence increases the effectiveness of alchemical items derived from it. Any save DCs associated with the item increase by 2, and any damage caused or healed by it increases by 50% (including ability damage). The hermetic flask can hold a maximum of 10 doses of alchemical essence at a time. The user can identify the properties of an unknown alchemical substance or poison by pouring it into an empty hermetic flask and succeeding at a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check for a normal substance, or a DC 30 or 35 check for a rarer substance. This analysis takes 1 minute and doesn't destroy the substance. Poisons analyzed in the flask can be converted into an antidote as part of this check, consuming the poison in the process. Such an antidote automatically cures the poison in any creature currently suffering from it, and provides immunity to further exposure to that specific poison for 24 hours. The antidote remains stable for as long as it's within the flask, and for 1 minute after it's removed. By expending one use of mythic power and using the flask as part of a Craft check, the user can halve the cost of materials needed to create an alchemical item or poison.

When carried by a non-mythic creature, a nexus crystal bestows the ability to survive the conditions of a hostile plane as though the bearer were native to that plane. For example, the crystal would give immunity to the fires of the Plane of Fire and the life-draining radiation of the Negative Energy Plane. Any adaptation given protects only against the hazards of the plane itself, not the creatures within it-fire attacks from creatures on the Plane of Fire are still hazardous to the bearer. The crystal doesn't provide protection against extreme conditions not normally experienced by inhabitants of the given plane, such as the vacuum of space on the Material Plane. When carried by a mythic creature, a nexus crystal has the following additional powers. • As a standard action, the bearer can bestow the crystal's planar adaptation ability to another by touching the creature with the crystal and expending one use of mythic power. The protection can be withdrawn over any distance on the same plane with a standard action. The use of mythic power can't be recovered while the protection remains in place. If another creature claims the crystal and uses this ability, any protection bestowed by the previous owner immediately ends. • As a standard action, the bearer can use plane shift to move herself and up to seven other willing creatures to any plane she is familiar with by expending one use of mythic power. If traveling to a location she's already visited, she can reduce the inaccuracy of plane shift by expending two uses of mythic power when she does so, in which case she appears 1d6-1 miles (minimum 0 miles) from her destination. • As a standard action, the bearer can touch another creature with the nexus crystal and expend three uses of mythic power to use plane shift to move the target to a random plane (Reflex DC 27 negates). • As a standard action, the bearer can expend two uses of mythic power to create a widened dimensional lock centered on the crystal instead of on a point in space. The lock lasts for 24 hours or until dismissed. • As a full-round action, the bearer can attempt to draw back other creatures that teleported away by expending four uses of mythic power. If she succeeds at a DC 40 Knowledge (planes) check, the bearer can draw back up to one creature per mythic tier she possesses that departed via a conjuration (teleportation) effect in the previous round. To draw back a creature, the bearer must be within 15 feet of the location the creature left from. If the creature resists, it can attempt a Will save (DC 25 + the bearer's tier) to avoid returning.

When slipped on a finger, it sizes itself appropriately. It's said the ring has a will of its own, but if it does, it evinces no obvious agenda. It favors wearers who possess strong personality traits-either those with strong morals, who exemplify goodness and honor, or those utterly devoid of morals, with the vilest and blackest souls imaginable. The ring especially favors mythic creatures, and often refuses to slip onto the finger of a creature that lacks strong personality traits or isn't mythic. The ring has no special power over the living, but when its wearer dies or it's placed on the finger of a dead creature it deems worthy, the corpse and equipment of the wearer remain where they are but the ring vanishes entirely. Within 24 hours, a tree grows in a location that's as close as possible to where the wearer died. The next day, the tree splits along the middle, revealing a cavity where the wearer has been resurrected whole and uninjured, with the ring still adorning her finger. If the wearer died in an unsafe place, the tree appears as close to that location as possible while still being relatively safe for the wearer. This rebirth comes at a price. The wearer receives certain knowledge that somewhere in the world, another being has been resurrected along with her-an individual of an opposite alignment who is every bit as wretched as the wearer is good, or vice versa. The opposite has roughly the same level and power as the wearer. The wearer has no knowledge of this other party whatsoever, other than that it exists and is free to do whatever it wishes-perpetrate any crime or perform any good deed- thanks to the wearer. This opposite is always brought back a considerable distance from the wearer.

Unlike a normal staff, a staff of eldritch sovereignty holds 50 charges and can't be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, and others don't. A staff of eldritch sovereignty doesn't lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The following powers don't use charges: • Arcane lock • Arcane sight • Daylight • Knock • Mage armor • Mage hand • Touch of idiocy The following powers drain 1 charge per use: • Black tentacles • Cone of cold (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half) • Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 18 half) • Greater dispel magic • Greater invisibility • Greater teleport • Lightning arcUM (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half) • Major image (Will DC 18 disbelief) • Suggestion (Will DC 18 negates) These powers drain 2 charges per use: • Summon monster IX (the summoned creatures receive the benefits of the Augment Summoning feat) • Plane shift (Will DC 22 negates, arrive 2 to 200 miles from the intended destination) • Prismatic sphere (DC 24) • Prismatic spray (DC 22) For 5 charges, the staff of arcane sovereignty creates a gate. The staff of eldritch sovereignty has higher DCs than normal for a staff. The wielder still uses her own save DCs if they exceed those of the staff. The wielder can use any of her metamagic feats on spells cast with the staff of eldritch sovereignty by expending 1 charge per increase in spell level, with a minimum of 1 charge spent. The adjusted level of the spell can't be increased above 9th level. For example, a user with Quicken Spell can spend 5 charges to cast a quickened cone of cold with the staff, but couldn't use it to cast quickened greater teleport. The wielder can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefit of a number of charges equal to her mythic tier. Any excess charges are lost. For example, a 5th-tier wielder with Empower Spell could expend one use of mythic power to cast an empowered fireball without consuming any charges from the staff. A wielder who knows the mythic version of one of the staff's spells can cast such spells from the staff by expending one use of mythic power. This can be combined with using mythic power to provide charges. Finally, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to add 1 charge to the staff, with no risk of explosion if the staff is already fully charged. A staff of eldritch sovereignty gives the wielder spell resistance equal to 23 plus her tier. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can be used to absorb arcane energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough energy to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if the wielder had performed a retributive strike (see Destruction). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her—the staff doesn’t communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Mythic Adventures","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"Destruction A staff of eldritch sovereignty can be broken for a retributive strike.

Non-mythic creatures that enter the cauldron take 4d6 points of damage per round until they climb out or die. The netherworld is small, with an overall area of 1 square half-mile. Highly mutable, the netherworld's appearance is determined by the will of whatever outsider currently waits there. Only one outsider can inhabit the netherworld at any given time. The specifics of what entity resides in the netherworld, as well as that entity's desire, change frequently and therefore are left to the discretion of the GM.

Such a champion can attain it only though a perilous quest that tests mettle and righteousness. Rather than being a physical object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth manifests as a glowing halo of light around the wearer's head. It's ordinarily as bright as continual flame, but in battle it brightens to the dazzling brilliance of daylight. Its radiance is treated as resulting from a 9th-level spell for purposes of interaction with other sources of light and darkness. The radiance of the nimbus can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action. The Nimbus of Radiant Truth grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the nimbus is worn. Its wearer can't deliberately utter a lie, though the nimbus doesn't prevent other forms of deception, evasiveness, and giving incomplete answers within the boundaries of the truth. All of the wearer's natural weapons and any weapons she wields overcome damage reduction as though they were good-aligned. In addition, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth has the following powers. • The wearer can bring forth a zone of truth (DC 20) with a 40- foot radius at will. By expending one use of mythic power, the DC increases to 30. • As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefits of freedom's call (as the Liberation domain power) or nimbus of light (as the Sun domain power) for 2 minutes. For purposes of this power, the wearer has a cleric level equal to her character level. Either power can be dismissed as a free action, but any unused duration is lost. • Seven times per day, the wearer can cure moderate wounds as a cleric with a caster level equal to her character level. The wearer adds her mythic tier to the hit points healed. • Three times per day, the wearer can unleash a holy aura (DC 25) or an empowered holy smite (DC 22). • Once per day, the wearer can unleash a blast of righteous power. Treat this as sunburst (DC 27) centered on the wearer, except that it has no effect on good-aligned creatures and inflicts double damage to evil-aligned creatures. After this power is used, the nimbus fades to a barely visible glow for 1 hour, and the wearer loses access to all of its powers save its enhancement bonuses. She remains unable to lie. • Once per week, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to perform a resurrection. The wearer of the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can remove it as though it were a physical item, and place it either on the head of another creature or on an inanimate object. When placed on an inanimate object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can be picked up. When placed on a living creature, it can't be removed except by the wearer's conscious choice. When donned by a creature of evil alignment, the nimbus blasts the creature for 20d6 points of damage, then teleports 1d10x10 miles away in a random direction. However, if the wearer becomes evil some time after donning it, the nimbus retains its powers and doesn't damage the wearer.

Once it infects a host, Plaguebringer renders h im immune to the e ffects o f any lesser disease. Despite this immunity, the host can still spread disease; indeed, his body becomes an incubator for the countless ailments of the mortal world. When exposed to a disease, the host automatically fails any saving throw to avoid contracting it, but suffers no ill effects. The host indefinitely remains an asymptomatic carrier for any diseases caught. Plaguebringer also grants the following abilities: • The host receives a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, caster level checks, and saving throws. • The host generates an aura of unlife in a 30-foot radius. All living creatures other than the host within this radius take 2d6 points of negative energy damage each round. Undead creatures gain fast healing 5 that stacks with any fast healing they already possess. This aura can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action. • As part of using an ability that requires him to expend mythic power, the host can target a mythic creature within 30 feet. If that creature fails a DC 23 Fortitude save, it contracts a random disease (as contagion) and one use of its mythic power is stolen and granted to the host. If the host fails to steal mythic power, he must expend double the usual amount of his own mythic power or the ability fails. • The host can use contagion heightened to 8th level (DC 23) at will. • The host can use empowered vampiric touch three times per day. • As a swift action, the host can expend one use of mythic power to gain the effects of death ward, divine power, and spell resistance. These effects last 1 round per tier he possesses and can't be dispelled. • Once per day, the host can expend two uses of mythic power to summon a nightwingB2 to do his bidding for 1 hour. If the nightwing is slain, a new one can't be summoned for 1 week. Plaguebringer is intelligent, with an Intelligence score of 15, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 20. It has a neutral evil alignment, communicates by empathy, and has an Ego of 30. It exists only to spread disease and cause suffering. It protects and aids hosts that please it. If infecting a host who resists these goals, it withholds its abilities and attempts to control the host. Plaguebringer can take a single standard or swift action on its host's turn to activate any of its powers that don't require a touch attack. It has five uses of mythic power available to expend each day. It can use its host's own mythic power by becoming dominant (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 535). When infecting a host, it has full access to its host's senses, along with darkvision and blindsense with a range of 120 feet. When not in a host, Plaguebringer has only limited awareness, with hearing and blindsense usable to a range of 30 feet and no vision. When not infecting a host, Plaguebringer is undetectable by normal vision due to its microscopic size, though detect evil reveals its presence. It can fly at a speed of 30 feet, and can infect a new host by entering its body. If the target fails a DC 30 Fortitude save, Plaguebringer infects it and the creature gains access to the artifact's powers. If the target succeeds, Plaguebringer can't attempt to infect it again for 1 month. Plaguebringer can leave a host by becoming dominant and choosing to leave. Immediately after it leaves, the host is affected by multiple contagion effects (DC 30), one for each of the diseases listed in the spell.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Mythic Adventures","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"To be destroyed, Plaguebringer must first be forced or tricked into the body of an angel.

The scepter's other end curls and forms an eyehook, to which is tied a leather strap. Strung along this strap are four small, copper bells. Each bell signifies a single concept related to rulership: authority, banishment, dominion, and imprisonment. An individual seeking to wield the scepter must first bond with the artifact by permanently offering it one use of her mythic power. Thereafter, the owner must always keep one use of power unspent to maintain the bond. If the owner expends all her mythic power, the bond breaks and the individual can no longer access any of the scepter's power until she reestablishes her bond of ownership. Once bonded, the scepter can be wielded as a +6 brilliant energy light mace that grants a +4 enhancement bonus to its bonded owner's Charisma score. In addition, the owner can expend one use of mythic power and ring the scepter's bells to produce the following effects: • The wielder can ring the bell of authority to cast command targeting any non-mythic creature. • The wielder can ring the bell of banishment to cast dismissal upon any non-mythic outsider with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier. • The wielder can ring the bell of dominion to cast sanctuary on any non-mythic creature. • The wielder can ring the bell of imprisonment to cast forcecage on any non-mythic creature with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier. The caster level for all four effects is equal to the owner's total character level plus her tier. When she rings a bell, she can also expend an additional use of mythic power to increase the DC of the spell-like ability's saving throw by 10. Lastly, the owner can use the scepter to appoint a mythic agent to be a protector and advocate of the owner's people. When she does so, she bestows 1d4 uses of mythic power upon that creature that last for 1 month if the creature is mythic, or until they are spent if the creature is non-mythic. If the agent is mythic, these points increase the agent's maximum number of mythic uses for the month. If the champion is non-mythic, as long as that agent retains at least one use of mythic power, it gains the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities (see page 12).","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Mythic Adventures","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The Scepter of the Shining Lord explodes if its owner uses it to appoint a non-mythic queen, lord, or other ruler as an agent.

Though non-mythic creatures can board the ship as passengers, the Silver Maiden requires a mythic creature to be its captain. If the ship currently has no captain, a mythic character can claim the captaincy by touching the ship's wheel and stating her desire to be captain. The captain then serves until death or voluntarily retirement. Upon assuming the captaincy, the captain becomes aware of all of the ship's powers, and can propel the ship completely unaided from anywhere aboard the vessel, whether sailing the high seas of a terrestrial world or gliding through the vast blackness of deep space. At will, the captain can expend two uses of mythic power to launch the Silver Maiden into outer space. Once in space, the ship can sail through the vacuum at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a voyage between two planets within a solar system takes 2d20 days, and a voyage to another star system takes 2d20 weeks (or more at the GM's discretion). The captain must know which world she wishes to travel to (as if the captain cast greater teleport). When the ship arrives at its destination, it slowly descends to the surface (as the feather fall spell), and typically lands in a body of water. Once earthbound, the ship moves as a standard sailing ship. If the planet has no water or comparable liquid, the ship lands on solid ground and is unable to move until the captain once again launches the ship back into space. The Silver Maiden can also sail the Outer Planes. At will, the captain can expend three uses of mythic power to transport the ship to another plane, as the plane shift spell. When the ship arrives at its extraplanar destination, it appears in a body of water or comparable liquid, 1 to 100 miles from the captain's intended destination. If the plane has no water (such as the Plane of Earth) the ship appears on solid ground, and is unable to move until the captain transports it to another plane. If the plane has neither water nor a solid surface, such as the Plane of Air, the ship continues to slowly fall (as the feather fall spell) until the captain t ransports i t to another plane. The Silver Maiden protects its passengers from the environmental dangers of deep space and the outer planes, and can even sail the molten surface of a star. At all times, the ship simulates a comfortable temperature and gravity normal for its current captain's home world. This protection extends 10 feet from the exterior of the vessel.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Mythic Adventures","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The Silver Maiden can be destroyed if its captain sails it into a black hole.","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"1","Abjuration":"1","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"1","AuraStrength":"none","WeightValue":"500","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"1","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2939},{"Name":"Tarnhelm","Aura":"strong conjuration, illusion, and transmutation","CL":20,"Slot":"head","Weight":"2 lbs.","Description":"This mithral cap includes prominent guards for the eyes and nose.

A creature with sufficient power and knowledge can bind the Trueforge to a fixed location to best take advantage of its power. Labor at the Trueforge requires both supreme skill and mythic power. Non-mythic creatures are affected as the feeblemind spell (DC 30) for daring to use the forge, and can't use the forge's abilities even if they succeed at their saving throws. When toiling at the Trueforge, a mythic creature can create magical weapons and armor with a cost up to her mythic tier squared times 2,000 gp, ignoring the nonmagical cost of the item created. For example, a 10th-tier character could craft a magic weapon of a +10 enhancement equivalent, worth 200,000 gp plus the cost of the weapon itself. The item forged must be at least partially metal, such as a breastplate or spear. Creating such an item requires only half the usual value of raw materials. However, to create items involving exotic materials (such as adamantine), the creator must use and have access to the normal amount of the material. Regardless of the materials involved, it takes 1 day of labor to forge a nonmagical light or one-handed weapon, shield, or suit of light armor; 2 days to forge a suit of medium armor or two-handed weapon; and 3 days to forge a suit of heavy armor. For items with magical properties, square the number of days of labor and multiply by 1,000 to determine the total gold piece value. For example, completing an item with magical properties worth 144,000 gp or less requires 12 days of work. The crafter must labor continuously on the item, not sleeping until work is completed, though she's kept awake and vigorous through the magic of the forge. If the work is interrupted for more than 1 hour at a time or more than 2 hours in a single day, the item is ruined, and half the value of the raw materials wasted. In addition to making normal and magical weapons and armor, the Trueforge can repair a broken magic item, generally in half the number of days it would take to make it from scratch. It can even repair or create an artifact, though such a task requires months of preparation to gather the proper materials followed by weeks of labor at the forge. Only one person can work the forge at a time. As the crafter labors, the Trueforge feeds on her mythic power and life energy, drawing it into the item forged. Forging nonmagical items carries less risk. The crafter must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save at the start of each day of work or gain 2 permanent negative levels. For magic items, the save DC is equal to 25 plus the number of days worked thus far. At the start of each day of labor, the crafter must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the number of days worked so far plus one. If the crafter accumulates a number of negative levels equal to her own character level or exhausts her mythic power, the labor proves fatal at the end of the day. Normally, this ruins the work in progress, but if this occurs on the final day of work, the crafter finishes the item as she dies. Her soul enters the item, making it an intelligent item with the crafter's personality-and likely some of her abilities, as determined by the GM. Creatures immune to level drain, whether by innate nature or magical protection, can't use the Trueforge.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"Mythic Adventures","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"The Trueforge can be destroyed by first destroying every object forged by it, then shattering the forge with a single blow from a hammer of thunderbolts.","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"1","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"1","AuraStrength":"none","WeightValue":"500","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"1","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2941},{"Name":"Armor Of The Pious","Aura":"moderate abjuration [good]","CL":9,"Slot":"none","Price":23300,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"25 lbs.","Description":"This gold-plated +1 mithral full plate armor has images of Iomedae's symbol etched into its immaculately gleaming surface.

A simple cord allows the relic to be worn as a necklace. The jawbone represents all of Galevius's substantial powers of negotiation. The power of the artifact is not in the jaw, but in the 16 teeth socketed into the bone. Upon donning the jawbone, the wearer understands all of its powers and limitations. As a standard action, the wearer may remove a tooth from the jawbone and crush it in an open hand to activate its powers. The jawbone does not function for an evil character; an evil wearer finds the teeth rooted too firmly in the bone to remove. When the Jawbone of the Venerable Galevius is first found, it contains a full set of 16 teeth. When a tooth is removed and crushed by the wearer, it provides the following effect for 1 hour, although an effect immediately ends if the wearer removes the jawbone or crushes another tooth. Incisors (4 teeth): These teeth are used for cutting; in a negotiation, an incisor represents an attack on an opponent's position. Crushing an incisor grants a +4 sacred bonus on Intimidate checks and attack rolls. Canines (2 teeth): Canines are used for tearing; in a negotiation, a canine represents a final, decisive strike in an argument. Crushing a canine grants a +4 sacred bonus on Diplomacy checks. In addition, whenever the user improves a creature's attitude with the Diplomacy skill, the creature's attitude automatically improves by an additional step (but does not exceed helpful). Premolars (4 teeth): Premolars can perform multiple functions; in a negotiation, a premolar represents a careful shift of position. When crushed, a premolar grants a +4 sacred bonus on Bluff checks. In addition, the user does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving. Molars (6 teeth): These teeth are used for determined grinding; in a negotiation, a molar represents reasoned tenacity and persistence. Crushing a molar provides a +4 sacred bonus on Sense Motive checks and immunity to fatigue and exhaustion. Despite the brittleness of the teeth socketed into the jawbone, the jawbone itself cannot be broken. Once all 16 teeth have been used, the empty jawbone immediately disappears, reappearing elsewhere in the world where a new owner is likely to encounter it.

Third Act: Iomedae battled Segruchen the Iron Gargoyle in midair. Study of this act grants the reader a +1 sacred bonus on damage rolls with longswords. This bonus increases to +2 when the reader is not standing on the ground. Fourth Act: Iomedae inspired a regiment of wounded knights to fight on. Study of this act grants the reader +1 bonus to caster level for the purpose of casting cure spells. Fifth Act: Iomedae smote Erum-Hel, Lord of the Morghs. Study of this act grants the reader a +4 sacred bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits with longswords. Sixth Act: Iomedae reforged her shattered sword with a prayer and an oath. Study of this act grants the reader a +2 sacred bonus to CMD to resist sunder or disarm attempts. Seventh Act: Iomedae appeared as an image to heal the virtuous and burn the wicked.

The rod cannot be opened except as part of the process to destroy it, as described below. When the Pauper's Thighbone is picked up, the new wielder immediately understands all of the powers and limitations of the artifact. When held like a rod, the Pauper's Thighbone can be used to enhance a spell with a metamagic feat the wielder already knows. The wielder can apply any one of her metamagic feats to a spell she casts without increasing the spell's casting time or the spell slot required. Enhancing a spell this way expends a number of the golden runes adorning the rod equal to the level increase of the spell normally required by the metamagic feat (for example, maximizing a spell with the Maximize Spell feat expends three golden runes). Enhancing a spell does not require an action and is performed as part of the casting time of the spell. Expended runes fade from bright gold to dull silver. Silver runes cannot be used to enhance spells, but they regain their golden color, and can be used again, at dawn each day. As the Pauper's Thighbone bears nine runes, it can be used to apply up to nine spell levels of increases daily. At the GM's discretion, if the artifact's owner intentionally ignores an opportunity to perform a selfless or generous act, one of the rod's runes flickers and permanently disappears, reflecting the paucity of the owner's soul. Inversely, if the owner of the Pauper's Thighbone performs a particularly generous act (such as giving away a large percentage of her wealth to the needy), an additional special rune might permanently appear on the rod. When possessed by an evil creature, the Pauper's Thighbone instead burdens its owner with the weight of his sins. In this case, the Pauper's Thighbone grants none of its powers and acts as a stone of weight. The rod can only be removed from an evil owner's possession if the owner dies or if the owner willingly gives the rod to a nonevil creature, and the nonevil creature willingly accepts it.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"AP 74","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"If a nonevil owner is so consistently selfish as to cause all the runes of the Pauper's Thighbone to permanently disappear, the rod can be broken open with a successful DC 35 Strength check.

It is engraved with delicate runes around the bottom lip, and measures 3 feet from lip to crown and 5 feet in circumference around the bottom. Sacred to the faith of Desna, seven such bells are believed to have existed at one point, each housed in a separate tower throughout the Inner Sea region. While these seven bell towers were separated by great distance, they represented the Seven Towers of Desna's palace, and pilgrimages to all seven were often undertaken by her faithful. Six towers are located in the western Mierani Forest of Varisia, the Hungry Mountains of Ustalav, the ruined city of Kokutang in the Sodden Lands, the eastern reaches of Tanglebriar in Kyonin, a hidden cove on Warlock Island in Cheliax, and somewhere in the hills south of White Canyon in Katapesh-over time, some of these locations have become quite dangerous. Each location presents its own dangers, and in some cases the bells themselves have gone missing. The seventh bell still hangs in its tower in an old fort in the eastern Stonewilds of the Worldwound. A Bell of Mercy's magic works only once per year, though it can be rung more often as a normal bell. When activated, the bell sanctifies the area around it with the effects of hallow with a 120-foot radius, and with the additional effects of protection from evil for every good-aligned creature within the area. Within a 60-foot radius, this also includes a chaotic good maximized forbiddance effect. Creatures whose alignments are not chaotic or not good take 36 points of damage (Will DC 19 half) upon entering this area, while creatures whose alignments are neither chaotic nor good take 72 points of damage. All evil extraplanar creature within 60 feet when the bell is rung must succeed at DC 20 Will save or be banished to their plane of origin-evil outsiders who resist this are still staggered in this area as a result of the bell's power. Finally, the immediate structure surrounding the bell becomes infused with magic, causing doors and walls within its forbiddance area to be magically treated (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 411) and repairing damage at the rate of 5 points of damage per round. These repairs cannot repair damage to a structure incurred before the bell was rung.

To take control of a retriever, the user of a retriever drone must have line of sight to the target and concentrate on it while holding the retriever drone in both hands. The target retriever can resist the attempt to take control by succeeding at a DC 16 Will save. If the retriever is currently on a mission to retrieve a target, it gains a +8 bonus on this save. If the retriever's saving throw is successful, the drone thrashes and scurries, making a single +15 bite attack (1d6+4 damage) against its carrier before becoming inert for 24 hours. If the retriever fails to resist, it falls under the control of the person who carried the drone-this control is permanent as long as the retriever drone exists and the person who activated the drone is chaotic evil. If the controller isn't chaotic evil, control granted lasts for only 24 hours. If the retriever controlled by a drone is destroyed, the drone itself crumbles to dust. As a full-round action while touching an active retriever drone, the user can look through the eyes of a controlled retriever and direct its actions. If the drone is destroyed while the user is linked in this manner, the user takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage (Fortitude DC 16 negates).","Requirements":"Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item, greater planar binding, scrying","Cost":4000,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"AP 75","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"1","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"5","PriceValue":8000,"CostValue":4000,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2978},{"Name":"Spherewalker's Staff","Aura":"moderate conjuration","CL":9,"Slot":"none","Price":43400,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"3 lbs.","Description":"This slender darkwood staff is topped either with a star-shaped crystal or a butterfly-like silver head.

The demon lord's personality and themes influence the nature of the newly formed isle, but little of its physical form remains save for its ichor. This lifeblood fossilizes deep within the island into Nahyndrian crystals. The majority of Nahyndrian crystals are flawed, but the most perfect of them retain the mythic power of their demonic source. These Nahyndrian crystals have hardness 30 and 120 hit points, and can be used in the creation of various powerful items. Nahyndrian crystals feel cold to the touch, and contact with one can be debilitating. When a creature touches a Nahyndrian crystal, it takes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain as flashes of horrific anguish flood the creature's mind (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A creature can only be affected in this way by a Nahyndrian crystal once in a 24-hour period. A creature that carries a Nahyndrian crystal on its person (even if the crystal is carried in an extradimensional space, such as a bag of holding) gains 2 negative levels; creatures with both the chaotic and evil subtypes only gain 1 negative level in this manner. These negative levels remain as long as the crystal is carried and are removed as soon as the crystal is abandoned. The negative levels from multiple Nahyndrian crystals stack. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way while the crystal is possessed (including via restoration spells). A creature who carries enough Nahyndrian crystals to gain enough negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice immediately dies-a humanoid slain in this manner immediately rises as an advanced bodak. A Nahyndrian crystal cannot be teleported. Anyone attempting to use a teleportation effect on a creature carrying a Nahyndrian crystal (including the creature itself) must attempt a DC 30 caster level check. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't work and is wasted; otherwise, the spell works normally, but any Nahyndrian crystals carried by the teleporter remain behind, dropping to the ground where the teleporter was previously standing.","Requirements":"","Group":"Artifact","Source":"AP 76","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"A Nahyndrian crystal can be destroyed by physical damage, provided the source can penetrate the crystal's hardness.","MinorArtifactFlag":"1","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"1","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"1","Transmutation":"0","AuraStrength":"none","WeightValue":"3","PriceValue":0,"CostValue":0,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"1","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":2997},{"Name":"Nahyndrian Elixir","Aura":"strong conjuration and necromancy [evil]","CL":20,"Slot":"none","Weight":"1 lb.","Description":"This thick, syrupy, deep purple elixir contains within it the ability to infuse a drinker with a tiny fragment of a dead demon lord's mythic power. So potent is this elixir that it must be stored in a magically reinforced cold iron flask capped with a mixture of lead and demon ichor-the flask itself is essentially a wondrous magic item that does nothing else and costs 8,000 gp to craft. Even then, the elixir's essence fills a 10-foot-radius area with unholy energies that sicken all living creatures (this is a poison effect with no saving throw). If the flask is opened, this radius expands to 30 feet. A thin sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, or 1 foot of stone blocks this effect. Once the flask is opened, the elixir must be imbibed within 1 minute; re-capping the elixir at this point doesn't reset or pause this countdown. If the elixir has not been imbibed in that time, the energy within explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 15d6 points of unholy damage (Will DC 25 half) to all creatures in the area of effect, destroying the elixir. If a creature drinks a Nahyndrian elixir, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain (demons automatically succeed). If a non-mythic chaotic evil creature succeeds, it undergoes mythic ascension-gaining either the first tier in a mythic path or a mythic rank, at the GM's discretion. A chaotic evil creature that is already mythic treats a Nahyndrian elixir as nectar of the gods (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 155).

Once purchased, a clockwork prosthesis is attached to the area where a limb once was-a prosthesis can't be added in addition to an already existing limb. Only humanoid creatures can equip themselves with clockwork prostheses, which must be installed by a trained prosthesis merchant. As a clockwork prosthesis is installed (a process that takes no less than 1 hour), the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or the prosthesis doesn't take hold. Either way, the bearer takes 2 points of Constitution damage from the surgery. Clockwork prostheses commonly come in two types-arms and legs. Clockwork Arm: A clockwork arm allows its bearer to lift up to 1-1/2 times his maximum load over his head. A humanoid with two clockwork arms can lift up to twice his maximum load over his head. In addition, a clockwork arm allows its bearer to deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike and provides a +10 bonus to its bearer's CMD against attempts to disarm a weapon held in that hand. For the appropriate price, a clockwork arm can be enchanted with any weapon special ability so long as the ability can be applied to unarmed attacks. Clockwork Leg: A clockwork leg allows its bearer to lift up to 2-1/2 times his maximum load off the ground (instead of double). A humanoid with two clockwork legs can lift up to 3 times his maximum load off the ground and stagger around with it. In addition, each installed clockwork leg grants its bearer a +4 bonus to CMD against trip and bull rush attempts. The clockwork prostheses detailed here are only the most common types of clockwork prostheses. Other, more specialized clockwork prostheses capable of transforming into firearms, pinning opponents, and even channeling magical energy are also rumored to exist.","Requirements":"Craft Wondrous Item, bull's strength, regenerate, creator must have 8 ranks in Craft (clockwork)","Cost":3200,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Wondrous Item","Source":"Magical Marketplace","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"1","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"1","AuraStrength":"strong","WeightValue":"25","PriceValue":6400,"CostValue":3200,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":3048},{"Name":"Loudshot Pistol","Aura":"faint necromancy","CL":3,"Slot":"none","Price":10530,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"4 lbs.","Description":"This brass-colored +1 double-barreled pistol has a dark oaken grip and ornate musical motifs etched into the entire surface.

When opened, the music box plays a delicate tune only a few notes long. Although worth 200 gp as a work of art, the music box's true value is as a spell repository. A spellcaster can store a single targeted mind-affecting spell of up to 4th level into a closed music box trap that is not currently storing a spell.

The original spellcaster remains the caster of the stored spell; for example, a charm person spell successfully delivered onto a target from a music box trap makes the creature well disposed to the spellcaster, even if the spellcaster is long gone. There is no obvious indicator that the music box trap delivers a stored spell onto the creature opening the box, but while the box is open, those who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check notice that the miniature dancer is keeping her gaze fixed upon the pending target.

A creature using a Strength check to move the inviolate marker risks being affected by a bestow curse effect (-6 Str; Will DC 16 negates and grants the creature immunity to the curse effect for 24 hours). An inviolate marker projects an illusory banner or crest from each side, each chosen by the creature that activated it, and is used to demarcate territorial boundaries. If an inviolate marker would be buried by a change in the landscape or environment, the marker teleports to the surface of the newly formed terrain in order to maintain its position relative to the new terrain.","Requirements":"Craft Rod, bestow curse, levitate, silent image","Cost":5000,"CostUnit":"gp","Group":"Rod","Source":"People Of The Sands","AL":"","Int":null,"Wis":"","Cha":null,"Ego":"","Communication":"","Senses":"","Powers":"","MagicItems":"","Destruction":"","MinorArtifactFlag":"0","MajorArtifactFlag":"0","Abjuration":"0","Conjuration":"0","Divination":"0","Enchantment":"0","Evocation":"0","Necromancy":"0","Transmutation":"1","AuraStrength":"moderate","WeightValue":"5","PriceValue":10000,"CostValue":5000,"Languages":"","BaseItem":"","Mythic":"0","LegendaryWeapon":"0","Illusion":"0","Universal":"0","id":3074},{"Name":"Ring Of The Godless +1","Aura":"faint abjuration and divination","CL":5,"Slot":"ring","Price":8000,"PriceUnit":"gp","Weight":"-","Description":"These rings are said to have first been forged in Rahadoum by the Council of Elders to help root out the hidden faithful and other practitioners of the divine.
