The kimono grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +4 bonus on all caster level checks.\nOnce per day, the wearer can capture a single creature within 60 feet within the kimono (no save), shunting the victim into an extradimensional space similar to that created by a <i><a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/maze.html#_maze\">maze</a></i> spell. Inside this otherworldly prison, the maze appears as an endless cherry orchard filled with “walls” of windblown cherry blossoms and cranes flying overhead. Each round on its turn, the victim inside the kimono may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the kimono as a full-round action. If the victim doesn't escape, it is released after 10 minutes, returning to where it had been before the kimono drew it in. If this location is occupied by another creature or a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space.\nWhenever a creature is drawn inside the kimono, the victim's image temporarily manifests as another embroidered design among the kimono's other images. While a victim is trapped inside, the kimono's bonuses on saving throws and caster level checks are increased by 2 (to +6). The kimono's increased bonuses return to normal when the victim is freed or released.",

The wearer gains a +5 bonus on <a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/perception.html#_perception\">Perception</a> checks, and can use earth glide to pass through up to 20 feet of natural or worked stone per day. The distance traveled with earth glide does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 5-foot increments. The wearer is able to safely chew, swallow, digest, and derive nutrition from gems, precious metals, and metallic ore, with 100 gp worth of these materials sustaining him for 1 full day. If the wearer removes the robe after such a meal, he is sickened until 24 hours have passed since the last meal of this kind. Wearing the robe again immediately negates this penalty.",
