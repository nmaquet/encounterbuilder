All living creatures (except witherstenches) within 30 feet of a witherstench must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated (unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention; can only take a single move action per turn) for as long as they remain within 30 feet of the creature. Moving out of the affected area leaves the character sickened (-2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks) for 1 round after which time he recovers immediately. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same witherstench's stench for 24 hours. A <i>delay poison</i> or <i>neutralize poison</i> spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A witherstench (also called skunk beast) is a mutated relative of the common skunk.
