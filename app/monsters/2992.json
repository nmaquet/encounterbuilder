The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the sea serpent's size, the sea serpent takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b>: Bite-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 41; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 2d4 Con; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The legendary shipbreaker is thought to be the largest of the sea serpents, a true behemoth that rules the seas. It is a fearless hunter that enjoys attacking the largest seagoing vessels and crushing them in its mighty coils. It is believed by many sailors and seafarers that the shipbreaker is a unique creature (i.e., that only one of these mighty beasts exists), and apparently (and thankfully) it seems to spend most of its time hibernating.</p><p>A shipbreaker attacks ships and huge-sized creatures as its primary prey.</p><p>It ignores smaller creatures except as snacks, or if directly threatened by one. Its favorite tactic is to ambush a ship or approach it at speed, then wrap it in its coils and crush it. It then feasts on the sailors in the water at its leisure. The shipbreaker is most often sighted deep at sea, usually just before it approaches and breaks up a naval vessel into kindling.</p><p>It is unknown what language the shipbreaker speaks or understands, if any, since none have ever reported successfully speaking with it. A shipbreaker's broad flat flippers allow it to slowly propel itself onto and across dry land.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Patrick Lawinger.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "24", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(38d12+418)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 32, Dex 13, Con 30, Int 11, Wis 17, Cha 21", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "50 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2992, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (poison), Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Dodge, Endurance, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Weapon Focus (bite), Improved Critical (bite), Improved Initiative, Improved Lightning Reflexes, Improved Natural Armor, Improved Natural Attack (bite), Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Swim-By AttackB, Toughness, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "33", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "31, touch 4, flat-footed 29", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Shipbreaker Sea Serpent", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +26, Intimidate +46, Knowledge (nature) +23, Perception +48, Sense Motive +9, Stealth +26, Survival +44, Swim +59", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "26", "Race": "", "CR": "25", "XP": 1640000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +33, Ref +24, Will +26", "Melee": "bite +43 (5d6+16/19-20 plus poison and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Colossal"}
