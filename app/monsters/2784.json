While not territorial, a cavern lizard is rarely encountered with others of its kind. Each cavern lizard often has a hunting ground covering up to 2 miles in the Under Realms.</p><p>A cavern lizard's lair is a large expanse of interconnected caves littered with the bones and scattered remains of its victims (including treasure). Hunting cavern lizards usually drag their kill back to their lair before devouring it. If young are present in the lair, the kill is divided between them. Young cavern lizards resemble their adult counterparts in all respects, save their eyes are a dull blue. During mating season (late summer, early fall) 1d6 eggs may be found in the lair. Eggs are round in shape, leathery to the touch, and gray in color.</p><p>Cavern lizards are aggressive ambush hunters. They prefer to scale the walls and wait for prey to pass underneath them where they drop down on their unsuspecting meal. In most battles, once a cavern lizard bites, it hangs on until its opponent is dead. If facing more than one foe, it won't employ this tactic so as not to leave itself defenseless against other aggressors. If cornered or extremely hungry, a cavern lizard fights to the death; otherwise it retreats if it is facing a particularly powerful opponent.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(5d10+15)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 3, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2784, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Climb, +4 Stealth (+8 in areas of natural stone or rock)", "AC": "16, touch 11, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Cavern Lizard", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +22, Perception +9, Stealth +10 (+14 in areas of natural stone or rock)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +6, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +10 (2d6+7 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
