The proto-creatures proved to be too dumb and too difficult to control. Rather than destroy the beasts, they were instead placed in suspended animation and secreted away at various locations in case a use should ever be found with them. All proto-creatures encountered to date have come from either humanoid or giant stock. Proto-creatures stand about 7 feet tall and weigh as much as 350 pounds. Giant proto-creatures are up to 12 feet tall and 1,500 pounds. The secret of their accidental creation has been lost, and proto-creatures cannot propagate their own species, so their dwindling numbers are limited to those that were first created by the Disciples of Orcus. Proto-creatures exist in constant pain. The only thing that distracts them from this pain is the release of combat. Therefore, they always seek to engage other creatures in combat upon first sighting them. The fact that these opponents also serve as their source of food is a merely a convenient byproduct. A proto-creature's body has been so warped and twisted by the experiments that created it, that it no longer has a recognizable physiology. This combined with its extreme resilience makes it immune to acid and electricity as well as sneak attacks, critical hits, and nonlethal damage. In combat, a proto-creatures prefers to focus its attacks on a single opponent, grappling and subjecting the victim to its acidic sweat as soon as it begins to flow. They have been known to be fooled into dropping a victim who goes limp and plays dead in order to move onto other opponents. Such a subterfuge requires a Bluff check opposed to the proto-creature's Sense Motive. Credit Original author Greg A.
