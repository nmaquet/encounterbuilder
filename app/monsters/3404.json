The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the bog turtle's size, the giant bog turtle takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check. </h5><h5><b>Current (Ex)</b> As a full round action, a giant bog turtle can induce a strong current by opening its mouth and inhaling large quantities of water. This strong rush of water lasts for 5 rounds and affects all in a cone-shaped area to a range of 100 feet. Creatures and objects of up to Large size are pulled toward the bog turtle at the rate of 20 feet per round. Affected creatures can make a Swim check (DC 30) to resist the current. A swimming creature cannot take 10 on its Swim check. The check DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Shell (Ex)</b> If it is severely threatened a giant bog turtle can completely withdraw into its shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When withdrawn, a giant bog turtle gains the benefit of cover (+4 AC against melee and ranged attacks). Since it cannot move when withdrawn into its shell, a bog turtle does not gain the +2 bonus to Reflex saves normally granted by cover.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>in desolate swamps, bogs, and marshlands. Their diet consists mainly of large insects, vermin, plants, berries, and aquatic varieties of the aforementioned things. Some, prefer a diet of meat to plants, and feed mainly on marsh animals such as alligators, crocodiles, and the occasional adventurer. Bog turtles are diurnal creatures and spend the nighttime hours sleeping in their lairs.</p><p>Giant bog turtles are solitary creatures; rarely is more than one ever encountered. Mating season is the only time more than one is encountered and it is short, one month during the spring. The female lays a clutch consisting of 1d3+3 eggs. The eggs are buried in swamp mud and hidden from predators and those that would steal them. The female stays near the eggs at all times except when eating or hunting. Gestation lasts about 3 months before the eggs hatch. Newborn bog turtles grow rapidly and are self-sufficient within one year. Young reach maturity around four years of age.</p><p>A giant bog turtle is about 20 feet long. Younger bog turtles have light stripes ringing their shell. As they age, the stripes slowly fade.</p><p>A giant bog turtle lies silently, drawn into its shell waiting for prey to pass near. At a distance greater than 30 feet, its shell resembles a large mound of earth or foliage and is often mistaken for such. Once prey moves within range, the giant bog turtle snaps its head out and attempts to swallow a foe. In deeper water, it opens its mouth and draws in water, plants, rocks, and pulls swimmers close enough so it can use its bite and attempt to swallow the creature.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d10+80 plus 16)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 34, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3404, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Endurance, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Initiative, Improved Natural Attack (bite), Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "26, touch 8, flat-footed 26", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Giant Bog Turtle", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +15, Swim +31", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate or warm marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +10, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +27 (3d8+18/19-20 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
