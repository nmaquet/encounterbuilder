This lasts for 1d6+6 rounds. Huge and smaller creatures within 20 feet of the kulgreer must succeed on a DC 34 Swim check or be yanked into the 30-foot diameter mouth of the whirlpool. As the whirlpool spirals through the kulgreer's frame, creatures inside are thrashed violently about taking 2d6+18 points of damage each round. A successful DC 34 Reflex save or DC 34 Swim check negates the damage for that round and allows the trapped creature to escape. The save DCs are Strength-based. During the final round of the vortex's duration, any creatures still trapped are pulled through the sphere of dim, white light in the kulgreer's tapered outlet. Such creatures must succeed on a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 12d6 points of damage. Those succeeding on their save take only half damage and are forcibly ejected from the kulgreer and flung 40 feet away. There is a 5% chance that any ejected creature is instead sent to a random plane of existence (GM's choice as to which one). The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The kulgreer is a massive, abominable being of the deep sea that creates powerful whirlpools inside its funnel-like body. It has a 30 foot long, conical body resembling a funnel, beginning in a wide mouth 30 feet in diameter, and tapering into a 5 foot diameter outlet of dim, white light. The kulgreer navigates the depths in a non-cognizant state, pointed-end first; its conical body gradually rotates and propels itself forward subconsciously, amassing various creatures into its frame as it passes through. If awakened from this state, the kulgreer is generally violent. It is popular belief that creatures sucked into the kulgreer's funnel-like body are teleported to another plane of existence. Though not consciously aggressive, the circumstances presented through a kulgreer's presence inevitably lead to conflict. If provoked, the kulgreer typically tramples its opponent in a fit of sudden sentience and conclude in the use of its supernatural ability.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (can't speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(24d8+144)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 34, Dex 10, Con 22, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4988, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Cleave, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (slam), Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Swim), Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "16", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "22, touch 6, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Kulgreer", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Escape Artist +15, Intimidate +29, Knowledge (arcana) +12, Perception +27, Swim +53", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "16", "Race": "", "CR": "16", "XP": 76800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any oceans", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +16, Ref +10, Will +16", "Melee": "slam +27 (4d6+18/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Gargantuan"}
