Unlike normal swarms, megaswarms are composed of Small creatures which are usually a megafauna version of a normal swarm and otherwise behave in a swarmlike manner. There are usually around 100 creatures in a megaswarm. The net effect is that they take only half damage from piercing weapons but take normal damage from other weapons. In addition when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or lower and breaks up, unless the damage was dealt by area-affecting attacks, then 2d6 surviving members of the megaswarm continue their attack, though now only as individual creatures. Otherwise, a megaswarm conforms to all of the other swarm traits as described in the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary</i>.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Much like a swarm of ordinary rats, a dire rat swarm is composed of a teeming mass of disease-ridden dire rats intent on feeding on whatever they can catch. A dire rat swarm usually exists in abandoned ruins or city dumps where there is a plentiful food supply and a lack of significant predators. A dire rat swarm seeks to overrun and attack any warm-blooded prey it encounters. It typically ignores undead and other creatures that are not warm-blooded. Credit Original author Greg A.
