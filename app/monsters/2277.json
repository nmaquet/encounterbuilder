These creatures fight as skeletons (see <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i> Bestiary), though their forms and structures do not necessarily have to resemble humanoids (or anything remotely humanoid). This ability otherwise functions similar to an <i>animate dead</i> spell (caster level 7th).</h5><h5><b> Bonestripping (Ex)</b> A bone cobbler can rapidly strip all the flesh from a Medium creature in 3 minutes using its claws and hammers. For each size category larger than Medium a corpse is, add 1 minute to the time it takes the bone cobbler to strip the corpse. For each size category smaller than Medium a corpse is, reduce the time by 1 minute (to a minimum of 1 minute). Once stripped, the bone cobbler devours the flesh and collects the victim's bones to use in its \"sculptures\". A creature slain in this manner can only be brought back to life by a <i>miracle</i>, <i>wish</i>, or <i>true resurrection</i> spell.</h5><h5><b> Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex)</b> In combination with its natural abilities, a bone cobbler's Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with both of its weapons at no penalty to attack or damage.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The bone cobbler is a tattered and desiccated humanoid and is often mistaken for a zombie at ranges greater than 10 feet. The bone cobbler is a malign and evil creature (thought to be from another plane or dimension of existence) that delights in slaying its opponents and stripping the flesh from their bones. Bone cobblers take the skeletal remains of those they kill and combine them with other bones in their lair. From these bones they sculpt and form weird humanoid or half-humanoid skeletal statues.</p><p>Bone cobblers stand 6 feet tall.</p><p>The bone cobbler attacks living creatures with its hammers. Slain creatures are stripped clean, their flesh and muscle devoured by the bone cobbler for sustenance and their bones carted away by the bone cobbler to be used in its abominable creations.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 12", "Gear": "2 light hammers", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2277, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (light hammer)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Bone Cobbler", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +11, Perception +10, Stealth +10, Survival +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +6", "Melee": "2 light hammers +7 (1d4+3) or 2 claws +6 (1d3+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
