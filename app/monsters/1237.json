Once a creature makes its save against this ability, it is immune to that golem's brightness for 24 hours. The DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Immune to Magic (Ex)</b> A glass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a glass golem, as noted below. <ul><li> A <i>shatter</i> spell damages a glass golem as if it were a crystalline creature. <li> A <i>keen edge</i> spell affects all of a glass golem's slam attacks as if they were slashing weapons. <li> A magical attack that deals cold damage <i>slow</i>s a glass golem (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 3 rounds (no saving throw). <li> A magical attack that deals fire damage ends any <i>slow</i> effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A glass golem gets no saving throw against fire effects. </h5><h5><b>Reflect Spells (Ex)</b> As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, a glass golem can align its internal structure to enhance its resistance to magic for 1 round. During this time, the golem reflects spells (even spells that function differently against the golem as described in its immune to magic ability) as if under the effect of a <i>spell turning</i> spell.</ul></h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A glass golem is a sizable guardian constructed by a powerful caster, usually in the shape of an armored humanoid. They are more common in desert lands where quartz-based sand is readily available, or in urban centers where glassblowing is commonplace. A typical glass golem is 10 feet tall and weighs 2,500 pounds. Stained Glass Golems (+0 CR): Divine casters sometimes build glass golems that resemble the windowpanes commonly found in temples. Thin and agile, these colorful beings often act as spies, wielding powers of stealth that their other counterparts do not possess. A stained glass golem has a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks. </h5><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION </b> A glass golem's body is made from 2,500 pounds of glass mixed with special salts and rare minerals worth 1,000 gp. </h5><h5><b>GLASS GOLEM </b> </h5><h5><b>CL </b>10th; </h5><h5><b>Price </b>33,000 gp (glass); 39,400 (stained glass) </h5><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION </b> </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>flame strike</i>, <i>geas/ quest</i>, <i>spell turning</i>, creator must be caster level 10th; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Craft (sculptures) DC 17; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>17,000 gp (glass golem); 20,200 gp (stained glass golem)</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1237, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 8, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Glass Golem", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +3, Will +4", "Melee": "2 slams +16 (2d8+5 plus bleed)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
