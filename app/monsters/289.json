As a culture, orcs are violent and aggressive, with the strongest ruling the rest through fear and brutality. They take what they want by force, and think nothing of slaughtering or enslaving entire villages when they can get away with it. They have little time for niceties or details, and their camps and villages tend to be filthy, ramshackle affairs filled with drunken brawls, pit fights, and other sadistic entertainment. Lacking the patience for farming and only able to shepherd the most robust and self-sufficient animals, orcs almost always find it easier to take what someone else has built than to create things themselves. They are arrogant and quick to anger when challenged, but only worry about honor so far as it directly benefits them to do so. An adult male orc is roughly 6 feet tall and 210 pounds. Orcs and humans interbreed frequently, though this is almost always the result of raids and slave-taking rather than consensual unions. Many orc tribes purposefully breed for half-orcs and raise them as their own, as the smarter progeny make excellent strategists and leaders for their tribes. <br></br><b>Orc Companions</b><br></br> Orcs are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All orcs have the following racial traits.<br><b> +4 Strength, -2 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma:</b> Orcs are brutal and savage. <br></br><b>Darkvision:</b> Orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. <br></br><b>Ferocity:</b> See universal monster rules, page 300. <br></br><b>Light Sensitivity</b>: See universal monster rules, page 301. <br></br><b>Weapon Familiarity</b>: Orcs are always proficient with greataxes and falchions, and treat any weapon with the word \"orc\" in its name as a martial weapon. <br></br><b>Languages:</b> Orcs begin play speaking Common and Orc. Orcs with high Intelligence scores can choose from among the following bonus languages: Dwarven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, Undercommon.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Orc", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-4), squad (11-20 plus 2 sergeants of 3rd level and 1 leader of 3rd-6th level), or band (30-100 plus 150% noncombatants plus 1 sergeant of 3rd level per 10 adults, 1 lieutenant of 5th level per 20 adults, and 1 leader of 7th level per 30 adults)", "Ref": "0", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10+1)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 7, Wis 8, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "javelin +1 (1d6+3)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "1", "id": 289, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Focus (falchion)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "warrior 1", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "13, touch 10, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Orc", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +2", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-1", "Race": "Orc", "CR": "1/3", "XP": 135, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate hills, mountains, or underground", "CharacterFlag": "1", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "weapon familiarity", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +0, Will -1", "Melee": "falchion +5 (2d4+4/18-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
