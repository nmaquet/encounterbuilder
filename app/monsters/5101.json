They still tend to associate with evil creatures but rarely anything as mundane or insignificant as a goblinoid. Occasionally they serve as mounts for ogres or hill giants. Like their lesser kin, dire worgs typically hunt in packs, though they don't limit their fare to herbivores or the sick and infirm. Dire worgs often challenge the most powerful member of an animal pack knowing that if the leader is killed, the rest are usually easy pickings. They have also been known to seek out isolated humanoid settlements and leave them as little more than smashed buildings and a few well-chewed and bloody bones. A dire worg has black fur, sometimes with reddish highlights, giving it an almost demonic appearance, and grows to be 10 feet long and 7 feet high at the shoulder. It weighs 1,200 pounds. Dire worgs typically attack in packs holding particularly powerful prey at bay until their giant allies or additional worgs arrive. A mated pair of dire worgs often has a pack of normal worgs serving them as bush beaters to chase prey into the dire worgs' clutches. Like their lesser cousins, they prefer to harry and exhaust tougher prey before moving in with flanking and trip attacks.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (6-11)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 29, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5101, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Natural Attack (bite), Run, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception, +2 Stealth, +2 Survival", "AC": "18, touch 11, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Dire Worg", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +7, Perception +12, Stealth +5, Survival +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests and plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +8, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +17 (2d6+13 plus trip)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Large"}
