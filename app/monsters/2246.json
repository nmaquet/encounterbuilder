They inhabit frigid hills and mountains where they spend their time engaging in activities they enjoy: hunting, fishing, and wrestling. Barbegazi homes are constructed of large blocks of ice and stone and are often built into the sides of hills and mountains or are in fact part of the mountain itself. Their homes are frequently targeted by white dragons (who consider their flesh a delicacy).</p><p>A barbegazi prefers to avoid combat, using misdirection and deception (including well-placed traps and pitfalls) whenever possible to mislead and detour potential opponents. If a barbegazi knows an enemy is coming, it will most certainly have several traps and snares in place by the time the enemy arrives. If a barbegazi engages an opponent, it usually opens combat with its <i>icicle blast</i> before moving to attack with its short sword.</p><p>A barbegazi is not stupid and will not risk its life in battle (unless it is defending its clan). If forced to flee, a barbegazi burrows into the snow and attempts to escape.</p><p>Barbegazis stand about 3 and a half feet tall and weigh 45 pounds on average.<b></p><p>Barbegazi Society</b></p><p> A barbegazi clan is led by the eldest male. Females play a lesser role than males in barbegazi society, though many are as capable (or more) than many of the males in the clan. Young barbegazi are trained from a young age in the art of combat and survival.</p><p>Aside from white dragons, barbegazis have tolerable relations with most cold-dwelling races and often initiate trade with frost giant clans.</p><p>Typical goods traded by a barbegazi clan are furs and meat. They do not associate or particularly care for frost men (q.v.).</p><p><br></br><b>Barbegazi Characters</b><br></br> Barbegazi leaders tend to be rogues or clerics.
