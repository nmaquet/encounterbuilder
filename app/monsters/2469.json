Though no link has been proven, however, it is known that three of the most powerful demonic knights (Baruliis, Caines, and Arrunes) make their home on the same plane of the Abyss as the Prince of the Undead within the shadows of his great citadel. The true origins of the demonic knight lay hidden deep in the stinking pits of the Abyss, and those brave few who have dared search for these secrets have never returned. The demonic knights serve their master (whoever it may be) with unswerving loyalty. They never question their orders and never question their superior. They are often sent to the Material Plane to recruit new bodies for their master's next plot or deception, or to punish those that have offended their lord. On some occasions, they are simply sent to another plane to corrupt and slay those that are just and good (to the delight of their master).</p><p>A demonic knight appears as a 6-foot tall humanoid dressed in black iron half-plate armor. Its head is completely hidden beneath a helmet that it never removes. A black iron longsword is slung at its hip. Some demonic knights don capes and other decorations as a badge of station.</p><p>It is unknown exactly how many demonic knights exist, but they are believed to number no more than nine.</p><p>A demonic knight attacks using its longsword (or fists, if unarmed).</p><p>Against powerful opponents, it attempts to use its breath of unlife to weaken its foes before slaying them. If melee goes against the demonic knight, it summons demons to aid it or cover its escape.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (demonic knight plus 2-4 shadow demons)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+45)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 13, Con 20, Int 18, Wis 18, Cha 18", "Gear": "masterwork half-plate, +1 anarchic longsword", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2469, "SubType": "(chaotic, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (longsword)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "31, touch 14, flat-footed 31", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Demonic Knight", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +16, Climb +12, Diplomacy +16, Intimidate +16, Knowledge (planes) +16, Perception +26, Sense Motive +18, Spellcraft +13, Stealth +7, Survival +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +4, Will +10", "Melee": "+1 anarchic longsword +17/+12 (1d8+7/19-20) or 2 slams +15 (1d6+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.
