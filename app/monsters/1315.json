All creatures within 30 feet when a poltergeist uses this ability must make a DC 14 Will save to avoid becoming frightened for 1d4 rounds. The poltergeist then resumes its invisibility at the end of its turn as a free action. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the fear effect of that poltergeist for 24 hours. If the poltergeist's natural invisibility is negated via other methods, it cannot use this ability. Likewise, those that can see invisible creatures are immune to this special attack. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> When a poltergeist is destroyed, it only remains destroyed for 2d4 days. After this time, the undead spirit reforms where it was destroyed, fully healed. The only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM. </h5><h5><b>Site Bound (Ex)</b> A poltergeist cannot travel more than 120 feet from the point at which it was created or formed. </h5><h5><b>Telekinesis (Su)</b> A poltergeist has no method of attacking apart from <i>telekinesis</i>. This ability functions as the spell <i>telekinesis</i>, with a CL equal to the poltergeist's Hit Dice (CL 3rd for most poltergeists). A typical poltergeist has a ranged attack roll of +3 when using <i>telekinesis</i> to hurl objects or creatures, and can use the ability on objects or creatures of up to 75 pounds. If a poltergeist attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 12 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A poltergeist is an angry spirit that forms from the soul of a creature that, for whatever reason, becomes unable to leave the site of its death. Sometimes, this might be due to an unfinished task- other times, it might be due to a powerful necromantic effect. Desecrating a grave site by building a structure over the body below is the most common method of accidentally creating a poltergeist. The poltergeist experiences great trauma over its condition; this trauma twists its psyche to evil and fosters an overall hatred of the living expressed in outbursts of rage. A poltergeist is bound to a specific place, usually a building, room, or recognizable area (a section of a cemetery, a stretch of lonely road, and so on). This place typically corresponds to its place of death or the resting place of its mortal remains.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or haunting (2-7)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d8+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 13, Con -, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1315, "SubType": "(incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (fear), Alertness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "12, touch 12, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Poltergeist", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +9, Perception +9, Sense Motive +3", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "site bound", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +4", "Melee": "", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 20 ft.
