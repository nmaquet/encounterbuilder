An ebony horse can extend this protection to its rider and up to four of the rider's allies in a 30 foot radius around itself. If the ebony and horse and any protected allies move more than 30 feet apart, the protection ends for that individual and cannot be regained for 24 hours. If the ebony horse is killed, this protection ends immediately. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes an ebony horse to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane. Other creatures protected by elemental endurance suffer damage normally from the elemental plane when that time expires.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Ebony horses are massive stallions prized for their loyalty, running speed, their ability to fly, and their ability to enter the various elemental planes unharmed. These creatures are often used by genies, demons, devils, and others due to their innate ability to withstand the various planar atmospheres and survive unharmed while simultaneously extending this protection to others. Ebony horses are generally solitary creatures but on very rare occasions a small herd of these creatures may be encountered. When not traveling the many planes of existence, ebony horses spend their time roaming vast grasslands on the Material Plane. They do not associate with normal horses or other steeds, preferring to keep company with their own. Ebony horses kick with their front hooves and lash out with a nasty bite when forced into combat. They are strong-willed and brave creatures, rarely backing down when confronted. They are, however, smart enough to know when the battle is lost and take to the air in such times. An ebony horse is fiercely loyal creature to its rider and, if on a hostile plane and protecting a rider with its elemental endurance ability, it will not flee and end this protection, even fighting to its death if necessary. Ebony horses have no known enemies, but tend to show aggression around nightmares. While no known enmity exists between the two, combat is as likely to occur as is no confrontation at all. Larger ebony horses (10 HD, Huge size) are known to exist and are used extensively by the seraphs (see the <i>Genie</i>, <i>Seraph</i> entry in this book) in their ongoing wars with the efreet.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, any two elemental languages (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran), any one planar language (Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or herd (2-4)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 18, Con 21, Int 13, Wis 17, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4812, "SubType": "(extraplanar, native)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Endurance, Flyby Attack, Run", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 13, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ebony Horse", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +17, Intimidate +11, Knowledge (planes) +12, Perception +16, Sense Motive +16, Stealth +11, Survival +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm and temperate plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "elemental endurance", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +10, Will +9", "Melee": "2 hooves +7 (1d6+2), bite +12 (1d8+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft., fly 90 ft.
