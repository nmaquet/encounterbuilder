Creatures caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. Creatures succeeding their save are sickened for 1d4 rounds instead. The cloud lasts for 1 round before dispersing. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A rakewood is a barely sentient plant creature that lives deep within old-growth forests. It consists of a filthy, spheroid fungal mass with a ring of three brown tendrils at the top. The tendrils surround a sphincter-like mouth lined with razor-sharp spiny teeth. Although it can move of its own accord through the use of finger-like cilia at its base, a rakewood rarely moves once it has settled itself. Rakewoods live on decaying plant matter, and generally they are content to let the world go by as the soak up nutrients from the leaf litter. In less productive seasons such as winter, rakewoods supplement their diet with animal flesh. Rakewoods are about 10 feet long and weigh 1,000 pounds. Coloration can vary from rakewood to rakewood, but most are dark green in color and covered in various fungi and molds. When at rest, a rakewood's tendrils appear to be tree roots or large, thick vines. A rakewood enters combat by releasing its cloud of paralytic spores. Any opponents left standing are then pummeled with its slam attacks. A grappled or paralyzed opponent is pulled into its maw to be swallowed.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or grove (2-5)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d8+66)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 10, Con 23, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5038, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Improved Critical (bite), Power Attack, Step Up, Weapon Focus (bite, slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in undergrowth", "AC": "24, touch 9, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Rakewood", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Perception +9, Stealth +5 (+13 in undergrowth)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +3, Will +4", "Melee": "3 slams +16 (1d8+8 plus grab), bite +16 (2d6+8/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
