They favor dense forests with thick foliage and spend their days basking in the sun or hunting for food.</p><p>A margay's diet includes small mammals, birds, bird eggs, small reptiles and amphibians, and fruits and nuts. They are active during both the night and day, having no set hunting or feeding time.</p><p>Margays generally mate early in their life (usually within the first year) and gestation lasts about 80 days. Young are born live and a litter consists of one or two young. Young margays are dependent on their mother for about 8 weeks before being able to forage and hunt on their own.</p><p>A margay looks like a small, slender, spotted cat. Its fur ranges in color from tan to brown or cinnamon. Its spots are darker and run in longitudinal rows along its body. Margays generally average about two feet long and weigh about eight pounds.</p><p>Margays attack with stealth and surprise but avoid conflict with creatures much larger than themselves unless cornered. When engaged, they attempt to pounce upon their prey and wrap their claws around the victims head, sinking their needle-like teeth into its throat.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair or family (3-5)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(2d8+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3479, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics, +4 Climb, +4 Perception, +4 Stealth.
