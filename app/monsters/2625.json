If the opponent or the marid is touching the ground, the marid takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. </h5><h5><b>Water's Fury (Su)</b> As a standard action, a marid can release a jet of water in a 60-foot line that deals 1d6 points of damage and blinds the target struck for 1d6 rounds. A DC 20 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the blinding effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Vortex (Su)</b> A marid can transform into a vortex of swirling, churning water once every 10 minutes. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind ability, save that it can only be used while the marid is underwater; a marid cannot leave a body of water while in vortex form.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Of the common genies, the marid is the strongest and most powerful and least numerous. They hail from the Plane of Water and rarely leave that plane unless called by a spellcaster or at the request of the marid potentate. They are generally friendly toward most other genie races, except efreeti-whom they hate and attack on sight. A marid stands about 16 feet tall nearly 2,500 pounds.</p><p>Marid society centers on a great Caliph whose citadel sits at the very center of the Plane of Water (a neat trick considering the infinite dimensions of the plane). The Great Caliph rules all marids and often sends them on missions into the other Elemental Planes or material planes on his behalf.</p><p>Marids generally avoid combat, preferring not to waste their time with such trivial things. If cornered or forced into battle, a marid uses his spell-like abilities as well as his water fury attack to disperse its foes. In melee, a marid wields a masterwork trident or pummels his foes with his powerful fists.<br><b>Noble Marid</b><br> Noble marids are the princes and pashas of the marid homeland. Noble marids have at least 15 HD and gain the following spell-like abilities in addition to the ones listed above: 3/day-<i>cone of cold</i>, <i>ice storm</i>; 1/ day-<i>elemental swarm</i> (water elementals only), <i>permanent image</i>. A noble marid's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 20th. Noble marid are CR 11.</p><p>Credit The Marid originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Auran, Common, Ignan, Terran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, company (3-6), or band (7-12)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+48)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 19, Con 18, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 16", "Gear": "masterwork trident", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2625, "SubType": "(extraplanar, water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Casting, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Improved InitiativeB, Power Attack, Wind Stance", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 14, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Marid Genie", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Craft (any one) +17, Diplomacy +18, Knowledge (planes) +17, Perception +17, Sense Motive +17, Spellcraft +17, Stealth +15, Swim +29", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Water)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "change shape (water elemental, humanoid or giant, alter self, elemental body III, or giant form I)", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +12, Will +10", "Melee": "2 slams +17 (2d6+6) or masterwork trident +18/+13/+8 (2d6+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Large"}
