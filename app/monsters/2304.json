Two long meaty arms sprout from a hugely obese frame; its head appears to be little more than a bald sloping brow with black pits for eyes. Its maw splits open to reveal cavernous jaws, teeth glowing like huge red hot coals.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Cherum</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 22</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>615,000</h5><h5>NE Colossal aberration (fire)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+8; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 120 ft.; Perception +45</h5><h5><b>Aura </b>fiery aura (40 ft., 6d6 fire, DC 36)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>37, touch 7, flat-footed 32 (+4 Dex, +1 dodge, +30 natural, -8 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>450 (36d8+288); fast healing 15 when touching fire</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+22, <b>Ref </b>+18, <b>Will </b>+24</h5><h5><b>DR </b>15/epic; <b>Immune </b>fire, poison; <b>SR </b>33</h5><h5><b>Weaknesses </b>vulnerability to cold</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +33 (4d8+14/19-20 plus 2d6 fire plus grab), 2 claws +33 (3d6+14/19-20 plus 2d6 fire)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>30 ft.; <b>Reach </b>30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>swallow whole (3d6+14 plus 2d6 fire damage, AC 25, 45 hp)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>39, <b>Dex </b>18, <b>Con </b>26, <b>Int </b> 12, <b>Wis </b>14, <b>Cha </b>12</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+27; <b>CMB </b>+49 (+53 bull rush, grapple); <b>CMD </b>64 (68 bull rush)</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Alertness, Awesome Blow, Cleave, Diehard, Dodge, Endurance, Great Cleave, Greater Bull Rush, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (bite, claw), Improved Initiative, Improved Lightning Reflexes, Intimidating Prowess, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Vital Strike</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Climb +53, Bluff +20, Intimidate +54, Knowledge (religion) +22, Perception +45, Sense Motive +24, Survival +23</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Common, Giant</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> warm mountains</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>double</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Fast Healing (Ex)</b> A cherum heals only if it is touching a flame or lava pool that covers at least an area equal to its space (30-foot area).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The cherum is an abomination born of intense heat and crushing despair. Often making their homes in lava sprues, they are thought to be the rejected offspring of a fire deity (or at least the creation of said deity).</p><p>As such, they are often worshipped as divine beings by primitive folk who offer virgin sacrifices to appease the \"God of the Mountain.\" The cherum greedily devours such gifts, demanding more and more delicate flesh to feed its insatiable appetite. A cherum's deific background subjects it to fits of rage that can be felt for miles (especially when the cherum goes on a rampage and destroys the countryside).</p><p>Though neutral by nature, cherum are often on decent terms with fire giants and other fire-based creatures that dwell near them. Though they do not trade with such creatures and rarely, if ever, aid them in time of need, they do not usually attack or demand homage from said creatures either. Cherum do not associate with dragons of any sort, especially red dragons for whom they have a great hatred.</p><p>A cherum stands about 70 feet tall and weighs well over 40,000 pounds.</p><p>Cherum are known to climb from a pool of molten magma, stretch forth their massive arms and devour everything in their grasp. They have little fear of dragons, demons, devils, or foolish adventurers who wander too close to their lair. They seek to grab and swallow everything smaller than themselves. If a fight goes against a cherum, it attempts to flee by diving into the nearest pool of lava and wait for its aggressors to leave as it heals.</p><p>Should this fail, it fights on to the death.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "18", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(36d8+288)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 39, Dex 18, Con 26, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "30 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2304, "SubType": "(fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Awesome Blow, Cleave, Diehard, Dodge, Endurance, Great Cleave, Greater Bull Rush, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (bite, claw), Improved Initiative, Improved Lightning Reflexes, Intimidating Prowess, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "22", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "37, touch 7, flat-footed 32", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Cherum", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +53, Bluff +20, Intimidate +54, Knowledge (religion) +22, Perception +45, Sense Motive +24, Survival +23", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "24", "Race": "", "CR": "22", "XP": 615000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +22, Ref +18, Will +24", "Melee": "bite +33 (4d8+14/19-20 plus 2d6 fire plus grab), 2 claws +33 (3d6+14/19-20 plus 2d6 fire)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Colossal"}
