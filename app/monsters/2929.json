This effect is identical to a <i>phantasmal killer</i> spell (caster level 13th) except it affects all creatures within 30 feet rather than just a single target and deals 6d6 points of damage (rather than 3d6 like the spell) on a successful Fortitude save. The Will save has a DC of 21and the Fortitude save has a DC of 21. A creature that succeeds on its Will save is immune to the phantasmagoria attack of that phasma for 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Wisdom Drain (Su)</b> A phasma feeds on the mental strength of its enemies. Its incorporeal touch deals 1d6 points of </h5><h5><b>Wisdom</b> drain each time one of its attacks hits. On each successful attack, a phasma gains 5 temporary hit points.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A phasma is an undead creature spawned when a humanoid or monstrous humanoid fails its Fortitude saving throw against a <i>phantasmal killer</i> spell and dies as a result. Phasmas are extremely evil and highly aggressive with a hatred for living creatures (especially arcane spellcasters) that knows no bounds. A phasma is usually found haunting an area within 500 feet of where it was slain when it was alive. It is not bound to this area and may travel or move wherever it pleases, though for some reason, a phasma rarely leaves the area where it died.</p><p>A phasma feeds on the mental strength of living creatures. By sapping a foe's mental strength it weakens its mind, thereby opening it up to the true power of the phasma, the ability to kill an opponent the same way it died-by a <i>phantasmal killer</i> effect. Creatures slain are left where they fall: the phasma has no use for the opponent anymore.</p><p>A phasma appears as a 6-foot tall incorporeal humanoid dressed in gray robes. A translucent and pale white light surrounds its entire body.</p><p>A phasma speaks the same languages it did in life and Common (though it rarely engages in communication with living creatures, other than perhaps to hurl insults and curses at its opponents).</p><p>A phasma engages any living foe it encounters. It begins melee using its incorporeal touch in order to feed on an opponent's mental strength, often focusing its incorporeal touch on a different opponent each round.</p><p>Once it feels it has weakened the will of its foes enough, it uses its phantasmagoria ability to try and kill its foes immediately.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(13d8+65)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 20, Con -, Int 15, Wis 17, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2929, "SubType": "(incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Combat Casting, Fly-by Attack, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (protection from good)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 20, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Phasma", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +21, Fly +13, Intimidate +21, Knowledge (any one) +15, Perception +23, Sense Motive +23, Spellcraft +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "13", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +11, Will +13", "Melee": "incorporeal touch +14 (1d6 plus 1d6 Wisdom drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 40 ft.
