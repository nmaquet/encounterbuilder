The being giving the order must have seen the creature to be found and must know the target's name. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. </h5><h5><b>Link to Caster (Ex)</b> When a soul eater is summoned to the Material Plane, it creates a mental link between itself and the caster who summoned it. If a soul eater's victim (i.e., the creature it is summoned to slay) is killed before the creature can devour its soul, the soul eater returns at full speed to the caster and attacks him. Likewise, if a soul eater is defeated in battle (but not slain) by its target, the creature returns to the caster and attacks him. So long as both the caster and soul eater are on the same plane of existence, the soul eater can successfully locate the caster (again as though guided by <i><i>discern</i> location</i>). If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster returns, or the soul eater enters a plane the caster is on, the link is immediately restored. </h5><h5><b>Soul Drain (Su)</b> When a soul eater slays a foe, it devours the victim's soul. Such a creature cannot be returned to life by any means save a deity's intervention. </h5><h5><b>Wisdom Damage (Su)</b> A creature hit by a soul eater's claw attack must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature brought to Wisdom 0 dies.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A soul eater is an extraplanar creature of great power. Its plane of origin is unknown but is thought to be some sort of void plane. Soul eaters are summoned to the Material Plane for one purpose-to slay living creatures. When given a target, a soul eater can track it unerringly.Soul eaters sustain themselves on the life energies of living creatures and derive this sustenance by draining the souls of living targets. A soul eater strikes with two ghostly claws in each round. It attacks until either it or its target is defeated or slain. A soul eater's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of over coming damage reduction.</p><p>Credit The Soul Eater originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>X4 Master of the</i> <i>Desert Nomads</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by David Cook.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "13", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 22, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 11, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3027, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Dodge, Flyby Attack, Improved Critical (claw), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+10 Stealth in darkness, smoke, or concealment", "AC": "25, touch 17, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Soul Eater", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Diplomacy +13, Fly +18, Intimidate +13, Knowledge (planes) +14, Perception +17, Sense Motive +16, Stealth +19 (+29 in darkness, smoke, or concealment), Survival +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land and underground, lower planes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "link to caster", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +13, Will +3", "Melee": "2 claws +16 (1d6+1/19-20 plus 1d6 Wis damage)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 100 ft., (perfect)", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
