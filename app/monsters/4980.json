Foul, dark magic brought down by inphidian sorcerers on others of their race resulted in this creature; the strongest of the inphidian race perhaps, but also the most weak-minded and slowest. Most gray-scales seemingly have no memories of their past life or the tortures inflicted on them; those that do however, have both a hatred and fear for magic and those that wield it. Gray-scales are considered by many inphidian nests to be dangerous, unstable, and an abomination against the race, particularly the gray-scales with the magic bane quality. These feelings, often times come from inphidian night adders (some of whom likely assisted in helping the gray-scale into its current state). Most often, gray-scales are shunned by their inphidian nest and cast out, left to wander the world and survive on their own, by whatever means they can. In some instances, a gray-scale stays with its nest, never fully accepted by many of the other inphidians, but tolerated, feared and respected for their battle skills. In these cases, one or more gray-scales serve as guards for the nest, or the muscle for an inphidian raiding party. A gray-scale inphidian appears as an 8-foot tall hulking and slightly hunched humanoid with slate gray scales, the head of a giant viper with elongated fangs and red eyes, and the distinguishing inphidian characteristic: the heads of vipers in place of its hands. They shun wearing both armor and clothing. Gray-scales understand the Inphidian language, but seemingly have trouble speaking it; communicating in a slow and broken tone. Perhaps a side-effect of the experiments conducted on them, or perhaps by design, but no sightings of female gray-scales have ever been reported. Likewise, gray-scales appear to be sterile, unable to reproduce with others of the inphidian race. In battle, a gray-scale inphidian prefers to overwhelm its opponents with its pure strength instead of attacking from ambush. It lashes out with both snake hands followed closely with a vicious bite from its viper head. A grabbed opponent is repeatedly bitten by the gray-scale until either it is dead or wounded enough to be out of the fight. The gray-scale then turns its attention to another opponent. If faced with a spellcasting opponent, it usually focuses all attention in the spellcaster's direction, even pushing through other opponents to get to the spellcaster.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Inphidian", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (1 gray-scale inphidian plus 2-3 cobra-back inphidians)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(8d10+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 8, Con 18, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4980, "SubType": "(reptilian)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Improved Critical (bite), Power Attack, Uncontrolled Rage", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 8, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Gray-Scale Inphidian", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +14, Intimidate +8, Perception +12, Stealth +2, Swim +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm forests and plains or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "magic bane (see text)", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +5, Will +7", "Melee": "2 snake-hands +13 (1d8+6 plus poison and grab), bite +13 (2d6+6/19-20 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Large"}
