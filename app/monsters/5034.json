Anyone touched by the mossy tendrils must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or fall under control of the plantoid. This otherwise acts like the <i>dominate person</i> spell except that the plantoid must touch the target and it functions on any Medium humanoid or monstrous humanoid. Control lasts for as long as the plantoid maintains contact. The victim also gets another saving throw to resist as described under the <i>dominate person</i> spell, and once every 4 hours after control is initiated. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Create Servitor (Ex)</b> Anyone who remains controlled by a plantoid for more than 24 hours becomes a plantoid servitor, all human reason irrevocably lost. A plantoid can only control and transform a single creature or servitor at a time.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Plantoids are creatures from another dimension or plane of existence, occasionally summoned forth into the Material Plane. The eyes are not magical, but the long strands of moss trailing after the plantoid have a very dangerous ability to enslave anyone caught within them. The soft, mossy consistency of plantoids makes these creatures immune to blunt weapons. The plantoids can snap their mossy beards out like whips, attempting to touch a potential victim. <br><b>Plantoid King</b><br> It is rumored that plantoid \"Kings\" exist, with 10 HD and a limited immunity to both spells (SR 11+ CR) and non-magic weapons (DR 5/ magic).</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Plantoid", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "group (1-8 plus one servitor per plantoid)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 8, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 16, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.
