An adult specimen is over 40 ft. long and nearly 5 ft. thick in its midsection. In bright light it can be seen to be covered with non-reflective black scales, and its underbelly is the dark red of clotted blood. Shadow hunters have the supernatural ability to blend in with shadows, both to protect themselves and to stalk and ambush prey. Unlike normal snakes, shadow hunters often work in groups of two or three to corner prey in passages.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Shadow Hunter Hatchling</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 2</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>600</h5><h5>N Medium magical beast </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+1; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 30 ft., low-light vision, scent, tremorsense 30 ft.; Perception +9</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>13, touch 11, flat-footed 12 (+1 Dex, +2 natural)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>22 (3d10+3)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+4, <b>Ref </b>+4, <b>Will </b>+1</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>shadowblend</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>20 ft., climb 10 ft., swim 20 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +6 (1d4+4 plus poison plus grab)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>5 ft.; <b>Reach </b>5 ft.</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>16, <b>Dex </b>13, <b>Con </b>12, <b>Int </b> 5, <b>Wis </b>10, <b>Cha </b>3</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+3; <b>CMB </b>+6 (+10 to grapple); <b>CMD </b>17 (can't be tripped)</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Ability Focus (poison), Skill Focus (Perception)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Climb +11, Perception +7, Stealth +6 (+16 in dimly lit & unlit areas), Swim +11; <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+10 racial bonus on Stealth checks in areas of dim or no light.</h5><h5><b>SQ </b>hunt by scent</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> underground</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary, or nest (5-8 hatchlings)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div></h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> DC 14 Fort; <i>frequency</i> 1/ round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Constitution damage; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s.

They are particularly fond of elf flesh, but eats any Small to Large creature as long as it is living, organic, and animal-based (i.e., not a plant or fungus). When they attack, they prefer to strike and envenom their prey, holding on and chewing the poison into their opponent until it stops struggling. If there is more than one foe present, they do not try to grab their prey, preferring to strike at those that threaten it, retreating if need be to return later to consume their hopefully dead prey.
