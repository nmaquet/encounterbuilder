The creature can <i>dispel magic</i>al fire as <i>dispel magic</i> (caster level equals the niln's HD). </h5><h5><b>Vapor Form (Su)</b> The niln spends the majority of its time in more or less solid form, but it can assume vapor form at will. It can switch forms once per round as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in vapor form. A niln in vapor form can fly at 60 feet per round (perfect). This ability is otherwise similar to a <i>gaseous form</i> spell (caster level 5th).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Niln hail from a plane made of air and water; a vaporous and saturated realm known as the Quasi-Plane of Vapor. They are normally docile creatures, but are quick to anger, and relentless in their attack.</p><p>Like many elementals, niln are most at home on their native plane and rarely leave it. They sometimes travel the Elemental Plane of Air when not traveling through their own realm, but usually do not enter other planes unless summoned. Should one find itself on the Material Plane, it seeks to escape and return to its home plane unless confined or summoned by a spellcaster. Assigned tasks are completed to the best of the niln's ability and they rarely ask for much of anything in return. On the Material Plane, a niln seeks sources of vapor or steam in which to bathe its form so they are almost always encountered in such areas.</p><p>When first confronted, a niln surrounds itself with its drowning fog to deter would-be-aggressors. Those that insist on entering the fog and attacking the niln are met by its physical attack; the niln forms wispy tendrils from its form and lashes out at its foes. A niln will use its drench ability to extinguish any source of light its aggressors may be carrying, relying on its darkvision to aid it in the darkness thus created.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Niln", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 19, Con 14, Int 6, Wis 13, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2848, "SubType": "(air, extraplanar, water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "Vapor Horror", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 14, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Niln", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +12, Knowledge (planes) +6, Perception +13, Stealth +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Quasi-Plane of Vapor", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "vapor form", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +8, Will +4", "Melee": "slam +9 (2d6+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 60 ft.
