Regardless of its type, a gorgimera's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 21 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. To determine a gorgimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below. <table><tr><th>1d10</th><th>Head Color Breath Weapon</th></tr><tr><td>1-2</td><td>Black 40-foot line of acid</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>Blue 40-foot line of lightning</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>Green 20-foot cone of gas (acid)</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>Red 20-foot cone of fire</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>White 20-foot cone of cold</td></tr></table> <i>Gorgon</i> A gorgimera's gorgon head breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds (no more than twice per day), turns a creature to stone permanently, and allows a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid. The save DC is Constitution-based. The breath weapon is a 30-foot cone.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>A gorgimera is a chimerical creature with the heads of a lion, dragon, and gorgon. It has the hindquarters of a gorgon and the forequarters of lion. It is a highly territorial predator whose hunting range often covers several square miles around its lair. The creature makes its home inside caves high atop mountains or deep inside caverns. A typical lair contains a mated pair and one or two young. A gorgimera's dragon head can be that of any of the evil dragons (see below). The lion head has no mane, and the scaled gorgon head is a deep navy blue with glowing red eyes.</p><p>A gorgimera prefers to attack from ambush. It usually attacks by biting with its lion head and dragon head, butting with its gorgon head, and slashing with its front leonine paws. In lieu of biting, the dragon head and gorgon head can emit their respective breath weapons.</p><p>Credit The Gorgimera originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2659, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (dragon breath weapon), Flyby Attack, Hover, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception", "AC": "18, touch 10, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gorgimera", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +2, Perception +6, Stealth +4", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate hills and mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +8, Will +4", "Melee": "2 bites +14 (2d6+4), slam +13 (1d6+4), 2 claws +13 (1d6+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 50 ft.
