The ravenous hounds attack as a single unit, have a +11 attack bonus, deal 2d6+3 points of force damage on a successful hit, and threaten a critical hit on a natural 20. This ability is otherwise identical to <i>mage's sword</i> (CL 7th). </h5><h5><b>Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)</b> A <i>raise dead</i> or similar spell cast on a duppy destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. </h5><h5><b>Strength Drain (Su)</b> Creatures hit by a duppy's touch attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. On each successful attack, the duppy gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>A duppy is the spirit of a cruel and brutal sailor who died by violence on land, away from his ship and crew, and thus was unable to receive a proper burial at sea. While its ghostly form is evidence enough of its twisted hatred, a duppy also possesses power over a pack of faithful, otherworldly hounds that share in their master's malignance. Duppies typically seek out sailors and pirates to exact their vengeance on, seeking to inf lict great violence on those living creatures who remind them of what they lost in life. For this reason, duppies are most often found in seaside towns or nearby beaches, and settlements that rely on the ocean know to fear and hate these ghastly beings. The presence of a duppy is often preceded by the distant sound of unearthly howling. While a duppy's incorporeal form ensures that it cannot be captured via mundane means, those who do manage to trick a duppy into a trap are wise to keep the horror confined until day, when its otherworldly abilities are hindered and it can be more easily defeated. However, few creatures can muster powers strong enough to cage a duppy, whose hounds confound enemies and allow the ghostly monster to attack victims from all sides.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Polyglot", "Source": "Isles Of The Shackles", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (3-8)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d8+36)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 22, Con -, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 19", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2732, "SubType": "(incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Lunge, Step Up", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 20, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Duppy", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +26, Intimidate +16, Perception +14, Sense Motive +14, Stealth +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm coastal regions", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +11, Will +8", "Melee": "incorporeal touch +12 (2d8 negative energy plus 1d6 Str drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 40 ft.
