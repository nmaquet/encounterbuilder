A magical attack that deals fire damage ends any <i>slow</i> effect on the sword spider and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the sword spider to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A sword spider gets no saving throw against fire effects. A sword spider is affected normally by rusting attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a <i>rusting grasp</i> spell. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> A sword spider's bite injects <i>poison</i> from a hidden reservoir within its metal body. Because it is a construct, the sword spider does not naturally produce this <i>poison</i>, and its creator must manually refill this reservoir. The reservoir holds enough <i>poison</i> for 5 successful bite attacks, after which the sword spider deals only bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 1 minute and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir with any injury <i>poison</i> (typically spider venom), though acid, alchemical substances, and even stranger liquids have been used. <i>Giant Spider Venom</i>: Bite-injury; save DC 14 Fort; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Strength damage; cure 1 save. </h5><h5><b>Sword-Legs (Ex)</b> A sword spider's legs act as longswords, granting it iterative attacks just as if it wielded multiple weapons. It cannot be disarmed and a sword spider never takes penalties to its attack rolls (for multiweapon fighting) when fighting with its sword-legs.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A sword spider resembles a giant-sized arachnid constructed of steel. Its eight spidery legs end in large sharpened blades resembles longswords or greatswords. A typical sword spider stands 10 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds. When activated, a sword spider fights relentlessly and tirelessly to vanquish its foes, slashing them with up to four of its sword-like legs. <br><b>Construction</b><br> A sword spider's body is constructed from at least 3,000 pounds of smelted steel. The metal must be of exceptional quality, and costs at least 5,000 gp.
