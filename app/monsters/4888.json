As a move action, the minotaur can teleport from one point in its lair to any other point in its lair, as if using <i>greater teleport</i>. In addition, whenever the minotaur must make a saving throw while inside its lair, it can roll twice and take the higher result. A mythic minotaur can change its lair once per week. A minotaur can share its lair with other creatures (including other minotaurs or mythic minotaurs) without interfering with this ability. </h5><h5><b>Natural Cunning (Ex)</b> Although a mythic minotaur is not especially intelligent, it possesses innate cunning and logical ability. This gives it immunity to <i>maze</i> spells and prevents it from ever becoming lost. Further, it is never caught flat-footed. </h5><h5><b>Oubliette (Su)</b> Whenever a mythic minotaur hits a creature with its gore attack as part of a powerful charge, the target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be sent into an extradimensional prison, as the <i>maze</i> spell but lasting for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Wisdom-based and includes a +2 racial modifier.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A mythic minotaur is but one or two generations removed from the original curse-born minotaurs that founded their race. Once created to punish to those who disobey or circumvent the orders of the gods, they use their innate magic to imprison, stalk, and consume humanoids-especially the descendants of the royal line whose blasphemy inspired the creation of this new race. Some mythic minotaurs are worshiped as demigods by primitive or fear-stricken humanoids, and accept sacrifices of young men and women to sate their hunger. They usually have custom armor and weapons appropriate for their large, inhuman frames, offered as gifts by worshipers or made by enslaved blacksmiths.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "Mythic Adventures", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-4)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+34)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 10, Con 15, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4888, "SubType": "(mythic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Greater Bull Rush, Improved Bull Rush, Power AttackM", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +4 Survival", "AC": "17, touch 9, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mythic Minotaur", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Intimidate +5, Perception +12, Stealth +2, Survival +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate ruins or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "maze mastery", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +5, Will +5", "Melee": "mwk greataxe +12/+7 (3d6+7/x3), gore +11 (1d6+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 2, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
