As a culture, catfolk are loyal, generous, and amiable. They like belonging to and being at harmony with a group whose members work together to accomplish their needs and wants. Tribal catfolk prefer for the most capable societal members to lead, so every tribe has a council of elevated subchiefs. A tribe's chief is usually the most competent (and magically talented) member of that tribe. Personal growth is part of catfolk culture, as is expression as a means of personal exploration. Catfolk have few taboos, and often exhibit harmless but strange eccentricities. Individuals cultivate a wide range of pursuits and self-expression, taking risks others might label unwise. Most individual catfolk like to be the center of attention, but not at the cost of group cohesion. </br><b>CATFOLK CHARACTERS </b><br> Catfolk have no racial Hit Dice, gaining their capabilities from class levels. All catfolk have the following racial traits. </br><b>+2 Dexterity, -2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma:</b> Catfolk are agile and amiable, but they are known for their lack of common sense and self-control. </br><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> In dim light, catfolk can see twice as far as humans. </br><b>Cat's Luck:</b> See above. </br><b>Sprinter:</b> See above. </br><b>Natural Hunter:</b> Catfolk receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. </br><b>Languages:</b> Catfolk speak Catfolk and Common.
