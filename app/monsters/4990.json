They make their homes upon the warm grasslands and plains of the world, living in prides of up to 20 or more individuals. Each pride has a leader, usually a fighter of 3rd-5th level. Some prides also have a shaman (a cleric of 2nd-4th level). Prides are territorial with areas covering up to 5 square miles. Prides generally do not encroach on another's territory. In cases where territories overlap, bloody battles are fought between the prides with the victors claiming rights to the area. Some particularly evil leonine prides worship Gorson, the Blood Duke (see <i>The Tome of Horrors Complete</i> by Frog God Games for details), and sacrifice captured humanoids to him. These prides feel a connection to Gorson and some believe he is the progenitor of the first leonines. A leonine stands 7 feet tall and can reach lengths of up to 10 feet long. Average weigh is around 700 pounds. Males sport long, flowing hair of black or brown and usually wear it braided. A strip of hair runs from the base of its neck, down its back, and blends into its lion-like body. Females are slightly smaller than males, wear their hair shorter, and do not have the strip of hair running down their back. While females generally take care of the young, they are just as fierce and effective in combat as males. Young leonines are born live and reach maturity within three years. If the young are threatened, the entire pride fights to protect them. Leonines fight with wicked, slightly curved spears and their forepaws. If disarmed, they can slash with their clawed hands. They attack from ambush when hunting, often tracking their quarry for several miles before springing to the attack. Leonines have a longstanding hatred for the tabaxi race and kill them on sight.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Leonine", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, hunting party (3-8 plus 1-4 lions), or pride (10-20 plus 4-6 lions)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+18)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4990, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Acrobatics, +4 Stealth", "AC": "16, touch 11, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Leonine", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +12, Diplomacy +2, Intimidate +7, Perception +14, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm plains and forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "feline passivism", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +7, Will +7", "Melee": "spear +9/+4 (2d6+6), 2 fore-claws +9 (1d4+4) or 2 claws +9 (1d4+4), 2 fore-claws +9 (1d4+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Large"}
