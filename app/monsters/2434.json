Their savagery in battle has turned the stomach of even the stoutest demonic general.</p><p>Chaaor are used as shock troops in the Abyssal armies. Many are the demon lords that have sent a battalion of these fiends against an army, watching in delight as the brutal chaaor tore its way through the enemy's ranks. When not engaging in wars with other infernal creatures, the chaaor spends its time roaming the Abyss in hunting packs. They have no preference as to the type or strength of prey: they pretty much hunt and kill what they choose. Chaaor packs have been known to attack creatures much larger than themselves and kill all opponents in short order.</p><p>A chaaor is a 12-foot tall, hulking, ape-like brute with the head of a bear.</p><p>Large downward curving, grayish-silver horns grow from its head and end in rounded points. The chaaor's body is covered in reddish-black fur and is almost always caked or matted in blood. The powerful arms of a chaaor end in razor-sharp and filthy claws-black in color. Long rows of sharpened teeth fill the chaaor's mouth. When moving, the chaaor usually drops to all fours. When facing an aggressor it assumes a bipedal stance.</p><p>Chaaor are deadly adversaries that relish the blood and adrenaline of battle. Their tactics are simple: target a foe, charge forward, and rake or slash with claws and bite. Often, a chaaor unleashes its mighty roar to begin a fight hoping to knock down as many foes as possible.</p><p>A downed foe is leapt on by multiple chaaors who proceed to tear the opponent to pieces. Likewise, if a chaaor grabs a foe, it holds on while the others move in and rip it to shreds with teeth and claws.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), or pack (6-11)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d10+66)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 17, Con 22, Int 8, Wis 14, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2434, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "24, touch 14, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Chaaor Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +22, Intimidate +16, Perception +24, Sense Motive +16, Stealth +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +10, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +18 (1d8+8 plus grab), bite +18 (2d6+8)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
