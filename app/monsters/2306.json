Many chupacabra attacks are blamed on vampires (because of the blood drain) or wild dogs or wolves (because of the ferocity of the assault), though in the latter two cases, if the chupacabra leaves any tracks, an observer can readily tell the attacker was bipedal and moved on two legs.</p><p>A chupacabra is a bipedal, almost humanoid-like creature about 3 or 4 feet tall. It weighs 60 pounds. Its fur-covered body is dark brown or dark gray and its eyes are bright red, and often appear to be glowing. Its arms and legs end in four-clawed digits and its claws are dull black.</p><p>A chupacabra cannot speak but utters a baleful moan when threatened.</p><p>A chupacabra attacks with its razor-sharp claws and powerful bite, striking from ambush whenever possible. If a chupacabra grabs a foe, it slashes its throat open and sucks out its blood. If facing only one foe, a chupacabra maintains its grapple until it has drained all of its opponent's blood. When it kills an opponent, the chupacabra tears it to shreds and gorges itself on as much of the foe's blood as it can.<br><b>Winged Chupacabras Rumors</b><br> speak of chupacabras with fur-covered almost bat-like wings.</p><p>There is a 10% chance that any chupacabra encountered is actually of the winged variety. Such a creature has a fly speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pack (2-5)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2306, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth", "AC": "15, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Chupacabra", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +8, Stealth +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm forests and hills", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +5, Will +1", "Melee": "bite +6 (1d4), 2 claws +6 (1d3 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
