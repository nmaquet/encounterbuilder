On the greruor's next turn, the acid ignites and the opponent bursts into flames taking 1d6 points of fire damage per round until extinguished. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves the acid damage and prevents the creature from catching fire. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Greruors serve in the infernal armies of several demon lords, particularly Tsathogga. They are strong, powerful, and brutal demons that delight in inflicting pain on others. They are extremely loyal and follow orders without question. Some greater demons, like nalfeshnees and glabrezus, relish the flesh of greruors' legs and often organize hunting parties to track and slay the frog demons. The greruors however are not the weak-minded brutes they appear to be and often win such confrontations using their deadly ranseurs and their large numbers to turn back their opponents.</p><p>A greruor appears as a massive, squat, bloated, frog-like demon with arms in place of its forelegs. Its wide, frog-like head has two 3-foot long horns protruding just above its deep, sunken eyes. It moves by hopping on its rear legs. Its arms end in talons which are usually clutched around the greruor's deadly ranseur. Its huge mouth sports razor-sharp teeth of a dull gray color. The greruor stands about 8 feet tall when on all fours.</p><p>In combat, they stand on their hind legs and attack with their ranseur.</p><p>The greruor's flesh is greenish-brown mottled with red or gray. Its skin constantly oozes and secretes a thick, mucus-like clear slime that is slick to the touch.</p><p>Greruors enjoy combat and seek it wherever they can find it. Normally they rely on their natural attacks, spittle, and weapons to fell opponents. If outmatched, they use <i>confusion</i> to disorient opponents, followed closely by <i>shatter</i>. Grabbed opponents are often held in the mouth of one greruor while another stabs the victim with its ranseur.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or troupe (3-6)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+60)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 17, Con 22, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "ranseur", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2442, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Escape Artist, +8 Perception, +20 Acrobatics to jump", "AC": "27, touch 15, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Greruor Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +3 (+23 jump), Climb +20, Escape Artist +24, Intimidate +16, Knowledge (planes) +15, Perception +27, Sense Motive +19, Stealth +12, Survival +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +10, Will +5", "Melee": "bite +16 (2d6+7) or tongue +16 (grab) or ranseur +16/+11 (2d6+10/x3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
