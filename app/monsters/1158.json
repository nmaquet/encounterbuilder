Constructs, elementals, and other creatures that do not possess flesh are immune to this effect. A successful DC 19 Fortitude save reduces the Dexterity drain to 1 point. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Planar Fast Healing (Su)</b> A denizen of Leng maintains a connection to Leng at all times, and when away from Leng, it has fast healing 5. It loses this ability on Leng or in areas where planar connections do not function. If killed, a denizen's body dissolves into nothingness in 1d4 rounds, leaving behind its equipment. A slain denizen reforms in Leng, similar to a slain summoned creature; it can only be permanently killed if its fast healing is negated. </h5><h5><b>Unusual Anatomy (Ex)</b> A denizen's internal anatomy varies from individual to individual, and has a 50% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack against it as a normal hit.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>These eerie denizens travel the universe from their strange homeland of Leng, walking uncontested only when they disguise themselves as humans by wearing loose-fitting robes and wrappings about the head and face. Under these disguises, they have horned brows, clawed fingers, mouths full of tentacles, and crooked goatish legs with cloven hooves.</p><p>Many scholars have argued over where the otherworldly realm of Leng lies- some believe it can be found among the Outer Planes, while others are convinced it can only be reached via a dimension of dreams. The denizens of Leng can travel to other planes freely, and often do so in strange, black ships, constantly seeking new breeds of slaves or trading rubies for unusual services or magical treasures.</p><p>At other times, their visits are much more violent, focusing on abducting victims for use as slaves or worse. On Leng, these denizens have long fought a war against that realm's monstrous spiders, a war that sometimes spills over into other worlds.</p><p>A denizen of Leng weighs 200 pounds and stands roughly 5-1/2 feet tall.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo; tongues", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), or crew (6-15)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 18, Con 19, Int 18, Wis 17, Cha 21", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1158, "SubType": "(chaotic, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Deceitful, Dodge, Mobility, Persuasive, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Disguise when disguised as a Medium humanoid", "AC": "21, touch 15, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Denizen of Leng", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +22, Diplomacy +7, Disable Device +14, Disguise +12 (+16 as humanoid), Intimidate +12, Knowledge (any one) +17, Perception +16, Profession (sailor) +8, Sense Motive +16, Sleight of Hand +17, Spellcraft +12, Stealth +17, Use Magic Device +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +11, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +14 (1d6+2 plus 1d6 Dexterity drain), 2 claws +14 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
