It is said that the blood of Lucifer himself and that of his most trusted advisors was mixed with that of mortal races to spawn this horrid hybrid. Before his fall, the wang liang were the former ruler of Hell's most devout worshippers. The wang liang organized themselves into monk-like sects and frequently acted as spies and enforcers in Hell and as emissaries and advisors to mortal rulers across the material planes.</p><p>A typical wang liang stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. It speaks Infernal and Common. At will the wang liang may cause their iron clawed fingertips and razor sharp fangs to drip with an infernal venom.</p><p>Wang liang prefer to use misdirection and intimidation to alter the outcome of fights and bide their time if possible to assault foes when they are at their most vulnerable. It is not uncommon for a wang liang to use allies to their advantage. When pressed into actual combat they use full attacks in an attempt to infuse their opponent with as much venom as possible.</p><p>Wang liang masters are often found leading monasteries of wang liang monks dedicated to Lucifer. Such monasteries dedicated to the Dark One are located in remote, out of the way places or cleverly disguised as another business or monastery if found within a populated area.</p><p>Wang liang were once greater than they currently are, having suffered great losses and in many cases a thinning of their infernal bloodline in the course of their masters defeat. Spiteful over their diminished authority, they now pursue strength through exercise of their old monastic ways and practice of martial arts or pursuit of sorcerous knowledge. The wang liang still organize themselves into regimented monastic orders, sending their most gifted champions out on missions to spread the words of Lucifer. <br><b>Wang Liang Characters</b><br> Wang liang leaders are usually monks or monk/sorcerers. Having been bred in the lusts of Lucifer and with the industry of the coal chambers of hell the wang liang player characters are often raised within the monasteries of lawful evil sects of monks upon the material planes. Due to their natural attacks and nerve numbing venom they quickly rise in the ranks of such sanctuaries of hellish intent, often serving as grand champions and grand masters. In Infernus, entire legions of wang liang monks are at Lucifer's immediate command, with several masters serving as elite bodyguards.<br>Wang liang characters possess the following racial traits.<br><b>+2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +4 Wisdom, +2 Charisma:</b> Wang liang are superior in mind and body.<br><b>Darkvision:</b> A wang liang can see in <i>darkness</i> to a range of 60 feet.<br><b>Racial Hit Dice:</b> A wang liang begins with four levels of outsider, which provide 4d10 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +4, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +3, and Will +3.<br><b>Racial Skills:</b> A wang liang's outsider levels give it skill points equal to 4 x (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1).
