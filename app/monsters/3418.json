An attached volt is effectively grappling its prey. The volt loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A volt has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached volt can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the volt is removed. </h5><h5><b>Shock (Su)</b> A volt delivers an electrical charge when it hits with its tail slap, dealing 2d4 points of nonlethal damage. An attached volt can attack the grappled opponent with its tail slap with a +4 bonus in the same round.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The origin of the volt is unknown and has eluded even the most learned of scholars. Referred to as bolt wurms in certain old grimoires for their ability to deliver a \"bolt from the blue\" with their whip-like tail, volts were once thought to be from another plane or planet, though evidence of late suggests they are in fact of this world. Other than that bit of information, the volt remains much of a mystery.</p><p>Volts inhabit underground caverns and caves, preferring to lair in areas dampened by water. A typical grouping consists of up to 20 creatures, though it's anyone's guess which are male and which are female (if such a thing among volts actually exists).</p><p>A volt's spheroid body is about 3 feet across. Its tail is nearly 3 feet long and formed of semi-hardened tissue. Its mouth, unseen at first by those viewing it, is located near the underside of its body and is filled with rows of needle-like teeth.</p><p>Volts are very aggressive and attack by latching onto a foe and draining its blood. An attached volt strikes with its tail and maintains its hold until either it or its opponent is dead.</p><p>Credit The Volt originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Jonathon Jones.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "gang (2-4), mob (6-11), or swarm (12-20)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d8+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3418, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "Bolt Wurm", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 14, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Volt", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +9, Perception +7", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +6, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +6 (1d4 plus attach), tail slap +1 (1d4 plus shock)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 30 ft.
