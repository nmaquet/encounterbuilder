Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save each round or take 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Stun (Su)</b> Whenever a blood reaver hits with a dire flail attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based. This ability is a function of the blood reaver, not the dire flail.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Blood reavers, also known as garugins, are dangerous and vile creatures that stalk the Hells searching for mortal plane jumpers. They believe no living mortal has the right to step into Hell; the only mortals that should be in Hell are the ones whose souls are corrupted in the afterlife or evil mortals that deserve to be there through actions and sins committed while still alive. All other mortals are trespassers and should be dealt with accordingly.</p><p>Blood reavers have a neutral relationship with most other devils; they can take them or leave them. They do seem to have a good rapport with bone devils, perhaps because the wicked bone devil is just as evil and corrupt as they are or perhaps because the bone devil shows no mercy when dispatching an enemy.</p><p>A blood reaver stands 8 feet tall and is never without its special barbed dire flail. The heads are wickedly crafted with oversized and strongly curved barbs so they do as much tissue damage as possible when they hit.</p><p>Blood reavers despise mortals and attack them on sight. They prefer to hide or stand nearby while invisible and let their siphoning aura drain a person of its blood, though the telltale sign that something is wrong is when the victim's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth begin to bleed for no apparent reason.</p><p>In combat, they attack with their barbed flails, relentlessly hammering away at their enemies and freely unloading with <i>walls of fire</i> to separate allies from one another. Being immune to fire, the blood reaver simply walks through the wall and attacks the creature standing on the other side.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, team (2-4), or squad (5-9)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+45)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 15, Con 21, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 14", "Gear": "barbed dire flail", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2471, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Critical (dire flail), Power Attack, Weapon Focus (barbed dire flail)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "24, touch 12, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Blood Reaver Devil", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +14, Diplomacy +14, Intimidate +14, Knowledge (planes) +14, Perception +14, Sense Motive +14, Stealth +14, Survival +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Hell)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +8, Will +8", "Melee": "barbed dire flail +16/+11 (2d6+9/19-20 plus stun) or 2 claws +15 (2d6+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Medium"}
