Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh around 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old, and dress in the finest clothing and jewelry available. To many, appearance indicates station. The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite).</p><p>Cloud giants have an unusually wide alignment spread- approximately half are good and half are evil. Good cloud giants build roads from their settlements to connect with other humanoid roads in order to foster trade. It's not uncommon to see a good cloud giant walking among humans, for example, in a human city near a tall mountain range. Evil cloud giants tend not to bother with permanent settlements and instead live on high peaks in crude shelters, only coming down to raid villages for whatever they might need. These two philosophies often see violent and long-lasting wars erupt between neighboring tribes.</p><p>Legends abound of magical cloud giant cities nestled in the very clouds themselves that float with the winds and circumnavigate the world. While most cloud giants recognize this as a fantasy, there are some who not only claim to have seen them but have dedicated the entirety of their long lives to finding them again.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Giant", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), family (2-5 plus 35% noncombatants plus 1 sorcerer or cleric of 4th-7th level and 2-5 griffons), or tribe (6-20 plus 1 sorcerer or cleric oracle of 7th-12th level and 2-5 griffons)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d8+96)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 35, Dex 13, Con 23, Int 12, Wis 16, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rock +12 (2d6+18)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 205, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Overrun, Intimidating Prowess, Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "16", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "25, touch 9, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Cloud Giant", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +19, Craft (any one) +10, Diplomacy +9, Intimidate +26, Perception +17, Perform (string instruments) +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "oversized weapon", "Saves": "Fort +16, Ref +6, Will +10", "Melee": "morningstar +22/+17/+12 (4d6+18) or 2 slams +22 (2d6+12)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "NG or NE", "Size": "Huge"}
