Her hair and fingers form the fronds of the willow, her arms and parts of her hair, the branches. From a distance, the witch tree is almost indistinguishable from a normal willow tree. Its skin is thick and dark, resembling the bark of a tree. Its legs join together to form the roots.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Witch Tree</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 11</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>12,800</h5><h5>CE Huge plant </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+3; <b>Senses </b>low-light vision; Perception +19</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>21, touch 7, flat-footed 21 (-1 Dex, +14 natural, -2 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>115 (11d8+66)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+13, <b>Ref </b>+4, <b>Will </b>+6</h5><h5><b>DR </b>10/magic; <b>Immune </b>plant traits; <b>Resist </b>electricity 10, fire 10; <b>SR </b>22</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>20 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>4 tendrils +16 (2d6+9 plus grab)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>15 ft.; <b>Reach </b>15 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>constrict (2d6+9)</h5><h5><b>Spell-Like Abilities</b> (CL 16th)</br>5/day&mdash;<i>charm person</i> (DC 18)</br>2/day&mdash;<i>dominate person</i> (DC 19)</h5></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>28, <b>Dex </b>9, <b>Con </b>23, <b>Int </b> 14, <b>Wis </b>13, <b>Cha </b>18</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+8; <b>CMB </b>+19; <b>CMD </b>28</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Alertness, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (tendril)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Bluff +11, Diplomacy +11, Knowledge (arcana) +13, Perception +19, Sense Motive +3, Spellcraft +10</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Abyssal, Common, Goblin, Sylvan</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> temperate forests</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary, grove (2-5)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Witch trees gain nutrients from the soil where they take root, but have a particular fondness for living flesh, particularly that of gnomes and orcs. As such, groves of these creatures can be found lairing near such settlements.</p><p>The origin of the witch tree is clouded; on one side, sages argue that the witch tree is a magical creation created by an insane spellcaster to do his personal bidding. On the other side, sages argue that the witch tree resulted from miscast magic or is the result of \"magical leakage\" perhaps created when a spellcaster attempting to create a magical wand or staff or other such item failed in his endeavors and cast aside the item, thereby allowing what magic it held to \"leak\" out into the surrounding soil. Regardless of the origin, the creature has multiplied significantly in numbers and shows no signs of becoming extinct anytime soon.</p><p>Some adventurers tell tales of a witch tree grove that lured the entire population of a small village to its death through magical charms and hexes. Such stories are not without merit, and most intrepid adventurers warn others of their kind when a witch tree grove has been discovered.</p><p>When a discovery is made, hunters, druids, and warriors move against the witch tree in an effort to remove the threat before villagers and livestock begin disappearing.</p><p>A witch tree sits unmoving until a potential target moves within range.</p><p>It first attacks using its spell-like abilities, attempting to charm or control its would-be assailants. Those that resist are attacked physically by the witch tree. A grabbed opponent is held until it escapes or dies or until the witch tree is killed.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Goblin, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, grove (2-5)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d8+66)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 9, Con 23, Int 14, Wis 13, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3433, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (tendril)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 7, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Witch Tree", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +11, Diplomacy +11, Knowledge (arcana) +13, Perception +19, Sense Motive +3, Spellcraft +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +4, Will +6", "Melee": "4 tendrils +16 (2d6+9 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Huge"}
