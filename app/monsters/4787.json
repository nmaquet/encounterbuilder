They are large, vicious canines highly prized for their ability to track and kill opponents much larger than themselves. Domesticated dire mastiffs are often trained and outfitted for war in spiked, studded leather armor. Orcs often use trained dire mastiffs in warfare. Dire mastiffs are much like wolves, and in the wild, they commingle in packs of up to twelve. The dominant male is always the leader, though other males frequently challenge for the position. Such exchanges, while violent, rarely result in death. The loser of the contest simply submits to the victor and acknowledges it as the new pack leader. Dire mastiffs are carnivores and their diet consists of just about any animal or creature they can catch and kill. Favorite meals include leopards, skunks, horses, and rodents. They rarely devour humanoid flesh, but will do so if food is scarce. Kills are often carried back to the lair and distributed among the pups and females. Dire mastiffs breed twice a year, usually every 6 months. The actual month or time varies depending on climate, terrain, and other environmental factors. Gestation lasts about 4 months after which time the female gives birth to 1d3+3 pups. Pups depend on their mother or the hunters of a pack to feed them and rarely journey out on their own until they reach 4 months of age. Dire mastiffs reach maturity around 8 months after birth. Before attacking, the hair on the neck of a dire mastiff rises, its ears fold back, its tail stiffens, and it bears its sharpened teeth, through which a low growl is often heard. A dire mastiff rushes its opponent and bites ferociously with its powerful jaws.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (3-12)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 15, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4787, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Acrobatics when jumping, +4 Survival when tracking by scent", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Dire Mastiff", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +7 (+11 jumping), Perception +9, Survival +2 (+6 scent tracking)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +7 (1d8+6 plus trip)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
