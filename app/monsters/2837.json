A muckdweller can take a move action to refill its mouth with muddy water so it can use its spray again.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The muckdweller is a small, swamp-dwelling bipedal lizard that lives on a diet of carrion, fresh meat, plants, and insects. It has a long tail that allows it to swim rapidly through the water or maintain its balance when standing upright. Muckdwellers sometimes associate with lizardfolk.</p><p>Muckdwellers stand about 4 feet tall. They speak their own language of croaks and hisses, and a rare few speak Draconic.</p><p>The muckdweller attacks by squirting muddy water at its foes. When it successfully blinds an opponent, it darts in and bites with its sharp teeth.</p><p>Credit The Muckdweller originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "pack (3-7) or swarm (8-17)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 6, Dex 14, Con 11, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2837, "SubType": "(reptilian)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Acrobatics, +4 Swim.
