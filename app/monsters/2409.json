Healing magic works as usual. </h5><h5><b>Crystalline Claws (Ex)</b> A crystallis's claws are extraordinarily strong and are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This is a function of the creature itself and if the claws are somehow detached or removed (say from a dead crystallis) they immediately crumble into fine powder. </h5><h5><b>Petrification Cloud (Su)</b> A crystallis can breathe forth a cloud of orange smoke as a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds. The cloud fills a 10-foot cube in front of the crystallis and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. A living creature caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or turn into a crystal, gem-encrusted statue. A <i>stone to flesh</i> spell cannot undo this effect, but a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> can. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Earth (Ex)</b> Crystallis' are immune to all attacks from earth creatures (creatures with the earth subtype). They cannot be affected by an earth creature's melee or ranged attacks or any special attack or effect that relies on touch or contact. Spell-like abilities and spells that do not require a touch attack cast by an earth creature affect a crystallis normally (but see its immunity to earth magic below). </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex)</b> Crystallis' are immune to all spells and effects with the earth descriptor and all spells of the Earth domain. Additionally, crystallises are immune to disintegration magic (a <i>disintegrate</i> spell for example).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Crystallis are massive elementals from the Plane of Elemental Earth.</p><p>On their home plane they spend time hunting and feeding on quartz and other precious stones. Crystallis are solitary creatures and do not normally associate with others of their kind or with other earth creatures. No one recalls ever seeing more than one of these creatures at the same time so how these creatures mate and reproduce is open for much speculation.</p><p>Sometimes a powerful spellcaster binds or summons a crystallis to its plane to do its bidding. The crystallis doesn't normally mind such a calling as it gives it a chance to hunt, collect, and devour precious stones on other worlds.</p><p>A crystallis stands 13 feet tall and weighs around 3,000 pounds. Its body is thickly built and formed of tightly packed earth mixed with quartz and other precious stones and gems.</p><p>A crystallis attacks by raking and slashing its opponents with its razorsharp claws, while at the same time attempting to position itself near as many of its foes as possible so it can use its petrification special attack. It readily uses its Power Attack feat to deal as much as damage as possible to its strongest enemies.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Terran", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(14d10+70)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 12, Con 21, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2409, "SubType": "(earth, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Great Fortitude, Iron Will, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "25, touch 10, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Crystallis", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Appraise +14, Bluff +17, Intimidate +17, Knowledge (planes) +17, Perception +22, Sense Motive +22", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "12", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Earth)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +10, Will +12", "Melee": "2 claws +21 (2d10+7 plus 1d6 bleed)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., burrow 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
