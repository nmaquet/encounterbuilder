Only violence can bring about the death of one of these creatures. </h5><h5><b>Overwhelming Mind (Ex</b>) A star-spawn of Cthulhu's mind is overwhelming in its power and alien structure. The first time a creature other than an outsider (excluding native outsiders) or aberration makes mental contact with a star-spawn of Cthulhu, it must make a DC 29 Will save to avoid being stunned for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the creature is merely staggered for 1 round. This effect can occur whether the star-spawn of Cthulhu initiates mental contact (such as via a <i>dream</i>, <i>nightmare</i>, <i>sending</i>, or <i>demand</i> spell-like ability, or merely by telepathic communication) or another creature attempts to do so (as if via <i>detect thoughts</i> or <i>dominate</i> monster). Once a creature is exposed to a specific star-spawn of Cthulhu's overwhelming mind, it is immune to this effect from all star-spawn of Cthulhu for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Limited Starflight (Ex</b>) A spawn of Cthulhu can survive in the void of outer space, and it wings allow it to use its fly speed in outer space despite the lack of air. Unlike creatures with full starflight (like the shantak), a spawn of Cthulhu's ability to fly in outer space does not allow it to reach unusual speeds. When it wishes to fly to another world, the creature relies entirely upon its immortality and otherworldly patience to complete the journey. When speed is required, it instead uses its <i>gate</i> ability to make the journey quickly. </h5><h5><b>No Breath (Ex</b>) A spawn of Cthulhu does not breathe, and is immune to effects that require breathing (such as inhaled poison). This ability does not grant immunity to cloud or gas attacks that do not require breathing.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Of all the strange and malefic denizens of the Dark Tapestry, few match the terror caused by this titanic race.</p><p>Hailing from a mad star whose light cannot be seen by conventional telescopes, the smallest of these behemoths stand nearly 30 feet in height. Humanoid in shape, their immense bodies have rubbery flesh that seems almost to wriggle and seethe like a half-solidified ooze. Tremendous draconic wings, murderous taloned hands, and a tentacled visage that evokes the alien gaze of an octopus complete the being's monstrous shape. This malevolent race has a name, yet it is no name known to the sane. Among mortal scholars, they are known merely by the name of their eldest source-they are the star-spawn of Cthulhu.<b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> The star-spawn of Cthulhu have a strange, mutable anatomy-their form is not fixed. They can absorb parts of their bodies or enlarge others as they will-a trait they often use with their claws or tentacles to dramatically extend their reach in combat beyond that which might normally be available to a creature of their shape and size. Despite this mutable shape, though, the star-spawn generally do not deviate far from the form of an octopus-headed, winged humanoid, likely due to the powerful links their otherworldly minds have to their overlord and master who lies dead but <i>dream</i>ing in the lost city of R'lyeh.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> Although they typically appear as immense humanoid creatures with rubbery hides and octopoid heads, the starspawn of Cthulhu are not any more aquatic in nature than they are terrestrial-that they are often found associated with a planet's oceans lies more in the simple fact that oceans often cover the majority of a planet's surface. The creatures themselves, being equally at home on land, at sea, or in the depths of space, make no real distinction between such regions, choosing them as the sites of their cities and temples for purposes only they can know. Servants of the alien gods of the Dark Tapestry, they work upon the worlds they invade to wipe them clean of indigenous life in preparation for the eventual expansion of the Dark Tapestry to replace all that exists with its strange realities.</p><p>The star-spawn of Cthulhu have little regard for indigenous life, yet they cannot proceed with their plans for a world while such life exists. Just as a man might move into a house he thinks to be abandoned, only to discover colonies of ants dwelling within the building's walls, the star-spawn work to eradicate indigenous infestations.</p><p>Their methods seldom vary from world to world-those whose intellects they can inf luence via <i>dream</i>s and <i>nightmare</i>s are besieged as they sleep, seeding the growth of destructive cults and societies that toil to do much of the spawn's work for them, preparing the world and bringing it to the brink of destruction. When such worlds are poised to tear themselves apart from within through unrest, civil war, excessive pollution, genocide, or worse, the spawn mobilize their cults to end all things. The only reward such cults receive for their (sometimes unwitting) aid is the dubious honor of being among the final few to be eradicated, for the star-spawn have no interest in and feel no responsibility toward their pawns. That these plans for eradication often span the length of centuries or even millennia should not be mistaken for sloth or lassitude-the spawn are inhumanly patient, and the preparation of the universe's worlds must follow an unknowable schedule, for only when the exact cosmic convergences are set and the stars are right can they make their final moves to end all things. This does grant some worlds with the capacity to discover the spawns' influence opportunity to delay or even defeat their world's star-spawned doom, but such tales of triumph are unfortunately rare in the face of the Dark Tapestry's relentless tides.</p><p><b>Great Cthulhu </b><br>While the star-spawn themselves hail from a distant world deep in the Dark Tapestry and can be found on countless other realms as gods and monsters, their lord Cthulhu dwells upon a distant planet far removed from Golarion. Yet while Cthulhu lies imprisoned in the corpsecity of R'lyeh deep under a great ocean, his <i>dream</i>s resonate still in the minds of his spawn, and from there touch upon the <i>dream</i>s of many slumbering poets and philosophers on countless worlds-including Golarion. Cthulhu himself is likely as powerful compared to his spawn as the spawn themselves are to the bulk of humanity, and thus statistics for this creature are relatively meaningless. Suffice it to say, if Cthulhu were to rise from his slumber, he could travel to any world upon which his spawn dwell, and as such, Golarion is far from safe should the stars ever come right for his awakening.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, telepathy 300 ft.", "Source": "AP 46", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or cult (3-6)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(25d8+250)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 42, Dex 13, Con 30, Int 23, Wis 29, Cha 24", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "30 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1709, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Critical Focus, Greater Vital Strike, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (claws), Improved Critical (tentacles), Improved Initiative, Improved Iron Will, Improved Vital Strike, Iron Will, Power Attack, Staggering Critical, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "18", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "36, touch 9, flat-footed 35", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Star-Spawn of Cthulhu", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +25, Intimidate +35, Knowledge (arcana) +34, Knowledge (geography) +31, Knowledge (planes) +31, Perception +37, Sense Motive +34, Spellcraft +34, Swim +52, Use Magic Device +32", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "25", "Race": "", "CR": "20", "XP": 307200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "limited starflight, no breath", "Saves": "Fort +18, Ref +9, Will +25", "Melee": "2 claws +32 (2d6+16/19-20), 6 tentacles +27 (1d8+8/19-20 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
