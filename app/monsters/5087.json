A black troll can induce this effect itself by stepping into a large source of fire that deals 20 or more points of damage in a single round. It must spend one full round in the flames for this method to work. This size change lasts 1 hour before the black troll reverts to its normal size.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Black trolls are an offshoot of standard trolls, believed to be supernaturally altered by magic. They dwell in the same climate as their normal brethren and often associate with them as well. Their appetites are no less impressive than other trolls, and some would argue theirs is even greater. Black trolls dine on anything they catch and kill, including scavenging and dining on the leftovers of other animals' meals. Black trolls do not eat other trolls, regardless of the food situation. Black trolls stand 14 feet tall and weigh around 1,000 pounds. When they swell to Huge size, they reach heights of 21 feet or more and weigh over 3,000 pounds. Black trolls flesh is rubbery to the touch and always shiny black in color. Eyes are almost always dull gray, though a few black trolls have bright blue eyes. Young are born live and reach maturity relatively quickly. Black trolls can mate with other trolls, but the offspring is always the same type as the other parent. Only black trolls mating with their own spawn another black troll. A black troll attacks by slashing and biting its foes. Its ability to deal horrendous amounts of damage is cause for concern among many that have faced a black troll. Often when in combat, a black troll shuns fire, hoping its opponent senses a weakness and decides to unleash a fire attack at the troll. Many adventurers have met their untimely demise this way. If the ruse doesn't appear to work, and there is a large source of fire nearby, a black troll subjects itself to the fire in order to grow to Huge size.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (1-2 plus 2-5 trolls)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d8+48)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 12, Con 23, Int 5, Wis 9, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5087, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Intimidating Prowess, Iron Will, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 10, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Black Troll", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +12, Intimidate +11, Perception +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +3, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +12 (1d8+7), 2 claws +13 (1d6+7)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
