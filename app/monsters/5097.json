Whether or not the save succeeds, that creature cannot be affected again by that water leaper's wail for one day. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Water leapers are the bane of fresh water fisherman. They snap angling lines and nets as easily one would snap a spider web. They lie in ambush in the shallows of lakes to attack anything that comes down for a drink, and overturn boats to feast on the fishermen as they struggle in the water. Water leapers inhabit nearly any source of fresh water, from river to lakes. They remain in the shallow parts of the lakes, only diving to deeper waters to avoid capture. A water leaper lair is underwater and usually close to the shoreline. Here the female deposits up to 30 eggs, most of which hatch within two to three weeks. Young water leapers resemble adults save their wings and tail. The wings are almost non-existent, consisting of two small ridges on the water leaper's back. The tail of a young water leaper is short and round, and lacks the barbed stinger of the adult. Both are fully developed by the time the young reaches maturity (in about 5 months). A water leaper has a lifespan of roughly 20 years. Water leapers are about 6 feet long and weigh 300 pounds. Coloration varies depending on the creature's surroundings and environment (water leapers gradually change colors over time to blend more with their surroundings), but usually consists of gray or brownish-green. Eyes are always dull brown. Water leapers hide in the water, waiting for prey to move close so they can spring to attack. They wail to immobilize their opponents then leap from their hiding places and attack, biting and stinging their prey.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or brood (2-6)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5097, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth (+12 in water)", "AC": "17, touch 12, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Water Leaper", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly -1, Perception +8, Stealth +6 (+14 in water), Swim +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +5 (1d8+3/19-20), tail barb +5 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., fly 10 ft.
