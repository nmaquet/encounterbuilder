Duergar dwell in communities deep underground, and appear as darker, more twisted versions of their kinder kin. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed with dust or ash, but this is a natural coloration that better allows them to blend with their underground surroundings. They are a race of slavers, but while non-dwarven prisoners are usually put to backbreaking work, dwarven prisoners are generally slain on the spot. In combat, duergar fire crossbows from a distance, then shift to the warhammer after a few rounds. If outnumbered, or given sufficient threat (and space), a duergar will use its <i>enlarge person</i> ability and begin lashing out at its enemies.<br><b> Duergar Characters</b><br> Duergar are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All duergar have the following racial traits.<br><b> +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma:</b> Duergar are hearty and observant, but also stubborn and belligerent. </h5><h5><b>Slow and Steady</b>: Duergar have a base speed of 20 feet, but their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance. </h5><h5><b>Darkvision:</b> Duergar can see in the dark up to 120 feet. </h5><h5><b>Duergar Immunities</b>: Duergar are immune to paralysis, phantasms, and poison. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. </h5><h5><b>Stability:</b> Duergar receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD against bull rush or trip attempts while on solid ground. </h5><h5><b>Spell-Like Abilities</b>: Duergar can cast <i>enlarge person</i> and <i>invisibility</i> each once per day, using their character level as their caster level. Both of these spell-like abilities affect the duergar only. </h5><h5><b>Light Sensitivity</b>: Duergar are dazzled as long as they remain in an area of bright light. </h5><h5><b>Languages:</b> Duergar begin play speaking Common, Dwarven, and Undercommon. Duergar with high Intelligence can choose bonus languages from the following: Aklo, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Dwarven, Undercommon", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, team (2-5), squad (6-12 plus 3 sergeants of 3rd level and 1 leader of 3rd-8th level), or clan (13-80 plus 25% noncombatant children plus 1 sergeant of 3rd level per 5 adults, 3-6 lieutenants of 3rd-6th level, and 1-4 captains of 9th level)", "Ref": "-1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 9, Con 15, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 4", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "light crossbow +0 (1d8/19-20)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "1", "id": 149, "SubType": "(dwarf )", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Focus (warhammer)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "warrior 1", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception relating to stonework, +4 Stealth", "AC": "17, touch 9, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Duergar", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +1, Stealth -3", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "Duergar", "CR": "1/3", "XP": 135, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "1", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "slow and steady, stability", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref -1, Will +1; +2 vs. spells", "Melee": "warhammer +3 (1d8+1/x3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Medium"}
