It has an unnatural cunning that belies its mindless nature and a natural instinct for killing. <br><b>Creating a Mythic Skeleton</b><br> \"Mythic skeleton\" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with the skeleton template (referred to hereafter as the base skeleton). <br><b>Mythic Subtype:</b> A mythic skeleton gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base skeleton. Instead of gaining additional abilities according to its CR, it always gains channel resistance +2, relentless, and superior two-weapon fighting. The mythic skeleton gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any). <br><b>CR:</b> Adjust the base skeleton's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base skeleton's CR other than from the mythic rank). <br><b>Hit Dice:</b> A mythic skeleton's Hit Dice are determined as though it were a zombie (<i>Bestiary</i> 288) instead of a skeleton. <br><b>Relentless (Ex):</b> Any melee attack made against a mythic skeleton provokes an attack of opportunity from the skeleton. <br><b>Superior Two Weapon Fighting (Ex):</b> A mythic humanoid skeleton usually fights with a scimitar in each hand. It does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons. <br><b>Other Mythic Skeletons</b><br> Other types of skeletons have the following additional or altered abilities. <br><b>Mythic Bloody Skeleton:</b> Destroying a mythic bloody skeleton in the area of a non-mythic <i>bless</i> spell doesn't prevent it from returning to unlife. <br><b>Mythic Burning Skeleton:</b> Add half the burning skeleton's mythic rank to its fiery aura damage and melee attack fire damage. Add its mythic rank to the DC of its fiery death ability. <br><b>Mythic Skeletal Champion</b><br> To create a mythic skeletal champion, increase its channel resistance by +2, and add the mythic subtype, additional Hit Dice as if the skeletal champion were a zombie of its size, and mythic abilities according to the base skeletal champion's Hit Dice.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Mythic Adventures", "Land": "1", "Organization": "any", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 14, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4895, "SubType": "(mythic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved InitiativeB, M", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "0", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 12, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mythic Human Skeleton", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "1", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +3", "Melee": "2 scimitars +3 (1d6+2/18-20) or 2 claws +3 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 1, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
