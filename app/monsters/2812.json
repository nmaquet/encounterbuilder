The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus. Creatures wearing metal armor take an extra +2 points of damage from a lightning mephit's breath weapon. </h5><h5><b>Fast Healing (Ex)</b> A lightning mephit heals only if exposed electricity (whether natural, such as an electrical storm, or magical, such as its own <i>shocking grasp</i> or <i>lightning bolt</i> spell-like ability). </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Water (Ex)</b> A lightning mephit takes 1d4 points of damage per gallon of water it contacts. Pouring water onto a lightning mephit requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level to a lightning mephit within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against a lightning mephit.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Lightning mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Air and Quasi- Elemental Plane of Lighting. Rarely are they encountered elsewhere unless summoned or called by a spellcaster. If encountered on a material plane it is usually in the employ of some spellcaster who has called it to do his or her bidding. Occasionally however, a lightning mephit stumbles into a material plane by way of a lightning storm (when said storm reaches into the Plane of Air and opens a temporary portal). Lightning mephits found anywhere except their home plane will be encountered in areas where lightning and storms are most prevalent. A lightning mephit is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound.</p><p>A lightning mephit begins combat with a <i>lightning bolt</i> attack, targeting the opponent closest to it. On the following round it breathes a cone of lightning on its foes if most are within range; otherwise it moves to melee combat. Once in melee, a lightning mephit uses its natural attacks and <i>shocking grasp</i>, as well as its breath weapon (if it can catch most of its opponents in the cone).</p><p>A lightning mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-4 mephits of mixed types), or mob (5-12 mephits of mixed types)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 17, Con 10, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2812, "SubType": "(air, electricity, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Initiative", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 14, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lightning Mephit", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +6, Diplomacy +6, Disguise +6, Escape Artist +7, Fly +14, Intimidate +6, Perception +4, Stealth +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Elemental Plane of Air or Quasi- Elemental Plane of Lightning)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +6, Will +3", "Melee": "2 claw +3 (1d4 plus 1d4 electricity)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.
