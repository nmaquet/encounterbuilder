It can make one extra attack per round as a full attack action, but each attack receives a -2 penalty. </h5><h5><b>Rend Armor (Ex)</b> If a slaughterford hits with both arm blades, it pulls apart any armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+6 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed. Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful Craft (armorsmithing) check.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Sometimes known as reaperborn, slaughterfords were bred from unknown humanoid stock by long-forgotten wizards in ages past. They typically dwell underground in burrows or caves and only venture to the surface world at night. They are not harmed by sunlight, but do not like it.</p><p>Slaughterfords move with an odd grace, capable of inhuman feats of agility and flexibility. Their faces are twisted mockeries of human expression, bearing reddish eyes, large noses, and perpetual sneers of evil and rage. Their secondary arms are much weaker and are only used for simple manipulation, never for combat. When the slaughterford is engaged in combat, it keeps its secondary arms folded against its belly.</p><p>A slaughterford strikes with its arm blades. In melee it relentlessly slashes and stabs until either it or its opponent is dead. It can use both of its arm blades with equal proficiency. Heavily armored opponents are subjected to its armor rending ability before being slashed and stabbed. A slaughterford gang works in concert to slay their foes, though when faced with overwhelming odds, slaughterfords attempt to flee.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+30 plus 10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 18, Con 17, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3018, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Critical Focus, Dodge, Improved Critical, Improved Initiative, Mobility, ToughnessB", "AlternateNameForm": "Reaperborn", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 14, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Slaughterford", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +14, Intimidate +14, Perception +14, Stealth +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "flurry of blows, rend armor", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +11, Will +8", "Melee": "2 arm blades +13 (1d8+3/19-20 x3) or flurry +11/+11/+11 (1d8+3/19-20 x3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
