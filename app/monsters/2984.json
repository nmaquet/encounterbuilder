Fascination lasts as long as the scarecrow is \"alive\" or remains within 300 feet of the fascinated creature. Note that the approach or animation of the scarecrow does not count as an obvious threat to the victim of this particular fascination effect (although the scarecrow's attack does count as an obvious threat and ends the fascination). This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Fear (Su)</b> The touch of a scarecrow infuses its target with overwhelming waves of fear. If the victim fails a DC 14 Will save, he is cowering and can take no actions other than attempting a new DC 14 Will save at the end of the following round (and each round thereafter) to throw off the effects of this fear. A successful save leaves the victim shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The animated scarecrow is nearly indistinguishable from a normal scarecrow. Close examination, however, reveals a tiny spark of red light in its eyes (DC 15 Perception check to notice). Each scarecrow is unique in construction and design, but most are about 6 feet tall, constructed of wood and ropes, and stuffed with straw or grass. Scarecrows are most often used as guardians to keep out would-be treasure hunters or trespassers.</p><p>A scarecrow attempts to fascinate the most powerful opponent it faces using its gaze attack. If it succeeds, it pummels that foe with its fists until the opponent is dead. It does not completely ignore other combatants as it uses its gaze attack to charm them so it can deal with them once its primary foe is dead.</p><p><br><b>Construction</b><br> Each scarecrow varies in appearance: one may have a stuffed straw head, for example, while another may have a pumpkin for its head.</p><p>Whatever the differences, scarecrows do have some elements in common: their bodies and all limbs are constructed of wood and bound by ropes; their clothes are almost always dirty and ragged; and most scarecrows are stuffed with straw or grass. Regardless of the materials used, unguents and special powders totaling 500 gp are also required.</p><p>SCARECROW <br><b>CL</b> 6th; <b>Price</b>15,500 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>cause fear</i>, <i>command</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>hold person</i>, creator must be caster level 6th; <b>Skill</b> Craft (carpentry or sculptures) DC 12; <b>Cost</b> 8,000 gp Credit The Scarecrow originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Roger Musson.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2984, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 10, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Scarecrow", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +1, Will +1", "Melee": "2 slams +8 (1d6+3 plus fear)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
