Metal simply passes through the lava child as though it did not exist. Metal items are not destroyed, just ignored. Any metal weapon (including magic weapons) that strikes a lava child deals no damage and simply passes through its body. Likewise a lava child can simply walk through metal doors or walls as though they did not exist. All attacks against a metal-armored foe are considered melee touch attacks as the lava child's attacks simply pass through the metal armor.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Lava children make their lairs deep underground and usually in warmer climates. Some lava children build their communities in dying or burned out volcanoes as well. Their society as a whole is reclusive, and rarely do lava children have dealings with outside races (magmin and fire elementals being the exception).</p><p>Lava children attack with their clawed hands and vicious bite. They direct their attacks against the most heavily armored foe (as their attacks can pass through armor) in an attempt to weaken their opponent's strongest (and probably front line) combatants.<br><b>Lava Children as Characters</b><br> Lava Children possess racial Hit Dice</b> and may have class levels.
