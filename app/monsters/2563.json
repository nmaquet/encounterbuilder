Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. </h5><h5><b>Negative Energy (Ex)</b> A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an <i>inflict</i> spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals. </h5><h5><b>Negative Energy Aura (Su)</b> A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals. Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. </h5><h5><b>Negative Energy Channeling (Su)</b> A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Negative energy elementals are creatures of pure negative energy. They are found primarily on the Negative Energy Plane, but on rare occasions, one slips through a portal or is summoned to the Material Plane.</p><p>These creatures seem to be able to communicate with others of their kind by changing the intensity of energy in their bodies and altering their shape ever so slightly. They do not speak any known languages.</p><p>Negative energy elementals hate positive energy elementals and always attack them on sight. Aside from that, negative energy elementals rarely engage in combat. If confronted however and forced into battle, the creature responds by pummeling its foes with its powerful fists dealing negative energy to its foe.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Negative Energy Fluctuation", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "17", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(13d10+52)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 29, Con 18, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2563, "SubType": "(elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Extra Channel, Flyby Attack, Improved InitiativeB, Spring Attack, Weapon FinesseB, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "26, touch 18, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Greater Negative Energy Elemental", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +25, Intimidate +16, Knowledge (planes) +16, Knowledge (religion) +16, Perception +16, Stealth +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Negative Energy Plane", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +17, Will +8", "Melee": "2 slams +21 (2d8+5 plus 2d8 negative energy plus energy drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 60 ft.
