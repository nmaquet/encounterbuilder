The <i>soul cage</i> is a magical construction that, through its crafting, has been endowed with a <i>trap the soul</i> spell. The spell requires no material components other than the debris from which it is created. The magic of the <i>soul cage</i> only functions for fishermen and the souls remain trapped for as long as the fisherman wishes and remains on the Material Plane. Usually, only upon the death of the fisherman may the trapped souls be released. A <i>soul cage</i> can hold up to six souls at any given time. </h5><h5><b>Deathwatch (Sp)</b> A fisherman makes constant use of the spell <i>deathwatch</i>, as cast by a 15th level cleric. The range of a fisherman's <i>deathwatch</i> is 1 mile per hit die, allowing it to sense the life state of any creature within its territory. This ability can be negated, but the fisherman can reactivate it the next round as a free action. </h5><h5><b>Exotic Weapons (Ex)</b> A fisherman is proficient in the use of the boat hook and gaff hook. </h5><h5><b>Gambling (Ex)</b> Fishermen are fond of games and gambling and should one be offered a fair chance of odds, he may find a wager impossible to resist. In this way, it may be possible to bargain for the release of the soul of a companion or loved one. Although evil, fishermen are bound by a personal code and honor the terms of a wager if they lose. </h5><h5><b>Spells</b> Fishermen cast divine spells as 9th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities. </h5><h5><b>Weather Sense (Su)</b> A fisherman always knows the condition of the weather within a 30 mile radius, even if he is currently underwater.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The fisherman is a rare creature not often encountered by the mortals of the material world. Sages and scholars often postulate these boathooks, gaff hooks, and nets to ensnare and slay those who intrude upon their habitat. All fishermen seem to be male - no female of the species has ever been witnessed by any sailor. They are powerful creatures who enjoy tormenting seafarers and work hard to collect the souls of those who die at the hands of the sea. At the bottom of the ocean they may be found tending to devices called <i>soul cage</i>s that resemble ordinary lobster traps, though they are used to imprison the spirits of the drowned. The territory of a fisherman can extend over a dozen miles from its lair. Fishermen stand between 11 and 12 feet tall and weigh 1,600 pounds. When a fisherman detects a great storm at sea, or is otherwise aware that sailors are meeting watery deaths, it rises to the surface in order to start collecting as many of the souls as it can. An individual fisherman may tend to as many as 3d6 <i>soul cage</i>s, each containing the incarcerated spirits of 1d6 unfortunate sailors, all of which have met their deaths through storm, shipwreck, or some other maritime disaster. Those slain by intentional violence are left to wander the depths by the fisherman. They are very competitive with others of their kind but occasionally they swap souls to enhance their own collections. Special Weapons Boat Hook: A boat hook resembles a quarterstaff with a barbed hook at one end. Sailors use boat hooks to snag mooring lines and pull in small boats. Because a boat hook is not intended to be used as a weapon, it requires the Exotic Weapon Proficiency to be used in that capacity. A boat hook is a double weapon. The damage is given as hook/staff. <i>Cost</i> 6 gp; <i>Small</i> 1d4/1d3, <i>Medium</i> 1d6/1d4, <i>Large</i> 1d8/1d6; <i>Critical</i> x2; <i>Weight</i> 5 lb.; <i>Type</i> Bludgeoning/Piercing. Gaff Hook: A gaff hook is a curved metallic hook with a cross bar. Gaff hooks are used by fishermen to lift heavy catches into their boats. Because a gaff hook is not intended to be used as a weapon, it requires the Exotic Weapon Proficiency to be used in that capacity. <i>Cost</i> 4 gp; <i>Small</i> 1d4, <i>Medium</i> 1d6, <i>Large</i> 1d8; <i>Critical</i> x2; <i>Weight</i> 3 lb.; <i>Type</i> Piercing.</p><p> aquatic spirits may hail from some other plane of existence, whilst others assume the fisherman is some strange form of undead, the powerful soul of a legendary seaman fated to lurk in the depths of the ocean. Sailors know only that they are to be feared. Although they do not often engage in melee combat, many have found to their own detriment that fishermen are quite skilled. Fighting with a variety of maritime tools and weapons, fishermen favor</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(15d10+120)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 15, Con 26, Int 15, Wis 21, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "net +16 (entangle)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4944, "SubType": "(aquatic, evil, lawful, native)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Diehard, Endurance, Great Cleave, Iron Will, Power Attack, Two-Weapon Fighting, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 11, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Fisherman", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +23, Craft (any) +20, Diplomacy +23, Intimidate +23, Knowledge (local) +20, Perception +23, Sense Motive +23, Swim +35", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "16", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious, create soul cage, exotic weapons, gambling", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +11, Will +16", "Melee": "+3 boat hook +26/+21/+16 (1d8+13) or +3 boat hook +22/+17/+12 (1d8+9), +3 boat hook +22 (1d6+9) or +3 boat hook +22/+17/+12 (1d8+9), +3 gaff hook +22 (1d8+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Large"}
