Hyaenodons (and hyenas) are generally thought of as scavengers but, in fact, most are skilled hunters quite capable of taking down large prey. When food is scarce, hyaenodons cover large areas individually in search of food, relying primarily on their sense of smell to locate potential prey.</p><p>Hyaenodons are very dangerous predators. They cover wide ranges of territory when hunting and prefer to disembowel their kills. These creatures either hunt alone or in large packs led by a single leader. Though they sometimes scavenge animals, the hyaenodon's sheer strength and size allows it to kill animals with ease (often animals larger than itself).</p><p>Favored meals include lions, deer, elk, moose, zebras, and bison. The largest hyaenodons (those of Huge size) do not generally hunt in packs.</p><p>They are solitary creatures by nature and hunt alone.</p><p>Hyaenodons have large, upward pointing ears and dark spots along their bodies. As they age, these spots grow darker. They range in size from 5 to 8 feet long and weigh anywhere from 300 to 330 pounds. The largest hyaenodons reach lengths of 14 feet and weigh up to 600 pounds.</p><p>Hyaenodons have massive jaws and large bone crushing teeth. They walk on their toes, and their claws are blunt and non-retractile. A distinguishing feature of the hyaenodon is the difference in length between the front and rear limbs, which gives it the appearance of always running uphill.</p><p>Hyaenodons generally circle their opponents, sending a few of their number against their prey from all sides. The larger hyaenodons simply charge and bite their prey, crushing bone and tearing flesh with their teeth.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (7-16)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+25)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 15, Con 19, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3470, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth in tall grass or undergrowth, +4 Survival (+8 when tracking by scent)", "AC": "17, touch 11, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Hyaenodon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +10, Stealth +3 (+7 in tall grass or undergrowth), Survival +5 (+9 tracking by scent)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm deserts", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +11 (1d8+12 plus trip)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
