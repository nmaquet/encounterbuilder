The gulper eel spends its life eating giant shrimp, and any other creatures which happen to arouse its senses.</p><p>Gulper eels spend most of their lives in the deepest and darkest parts of the oceans, rarely if ever venturing near the surface waters. Solitary creatures by nature, during mating season (colder months of the year), it is common to find a pair of these creatures dwelling together. During mating season, the female deposits her eggs (2-8) in the dirt and mass of plants on the ocean floor. Within two months the eggs hatch and the young swim free. Young are independent within 2 weeks after birth and venture out on their own shortly thereafter.</p><p>A gulper eel averages 10 feet in length but can grow to reach 30 feet or more. Its body is long, sleek, and black in color and its tail ends in a luminous organ. Its eyes are small for its body and close to its snout. It massive mouth is lined with rows of sharpened teeth.</p><p>Gulper eels attempt to bite their prey, holding it before swallowing it whole. Because a gulper eel can unhinge its jaw and stretch its stomach, it can swallow opponents larger than itself.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d8+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3461, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Swim-by Attack, Toughness, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Gulper Eel", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +11, Swim +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +8, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +9 (2d6+4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
