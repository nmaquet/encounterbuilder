The existence of an ectoplasmic being is a cruel one, and few souls willingly choose this fate of painful undeath. Ectoplasm resembles thick tangles of slimy linen or dripping goo, and is as grotesque to touch as it is to gaze upon.</p><p>An ectoplasmic creature is approximately the same size as whatever body it inhabited in life, though it weighs nearly twice as much, the ropes of undead matter that compose its body being significantly heavier than most flesh.<b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> Though generally considered a fable by all but those who have had the misfortune of witnessing its horrid form, ectoplasm is as real as it is accursed.</p><p>Even more so than most undead beings, creatures born of ectoplasm live hateful existences filled with a lust for destruction and suffering. They have no bodily needs and require no sustenance; the only thing an ectoplasmic creature feeds upon is its own hatred for the living.</p><p>Once a spirit has passed to the afterlife, it seldom wishes to return at all, let alone in a disfigured ectoplasmic body. Spirits that are not powerful enough to come back as ghosts or spectres sometimes enter the Material Plane as ectoplasmic monsters, particularly when there are no remains of the creature's original body for its soul to inhabit so as to become a skeleton or zombie. Sometimes, ghosts and other strong undead purposefully draw upon ectoplasm from the ethereal realm, yearning for even more power in their ectoplasmic hosts.</p><p>Those who suffer this unfortunate fate, either by misfortune or choice, are usually stuck in their ectoplasmic prison until death once again takes hold of them. The transition from death to ectoplasmic undeath is a torturous ordeal, as is retaining the horrid form into which the creature is reborn. Often, this persistent agony drives ectoplasmic beings mad, creating within them an insatiable rage akin to that experienced by frustrated ghosts and other haunted souls.</p><p></h5><h5>An ectoplasmic creature's burning desperation and embitterment often push it toward violence, and most such beings fling themselves into battle willingly, killing to satiate their natural hunger for others' suffering while simultaneously hoping to be killed so as to end their own.</p><p>Ectoplasmic creatures leave a trail of a silvery substance that resembles a slug's mucus, a trait almost exclusive to these undead. This slippery secretion has the consistency of jelly, and is easily distinguishable to the trained eye. The residue dries quickly, however, so its presence is extremely foreboding for those who can identify it.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> Ectoplasmic beings can inhabit virtually any location, regardless of environment or climate. The horrors tend to prowl the areas in which they died and rarely venture outside these often confined spaces.</p><p>Ectoplasmic creatures are sometimes found in groups, and when they are it is because they were allies or partners in life and have chosen to come back for some joined purpose, only to be locked in the excruciating form of ectoplasmic horrors.</p><p>While of average intelligence, ectoplasmic beings rarely coordinate complicated actions with their brethren, only strategizing when it benefits them to attack victims stealthily. Their unnatural strength makes ectoplasmic creatures formidable combatants, and thus all the more frightening when undetected. Fortunately for the wary, the sticky ectoplasm that trails behind these undead monsters is a clear indicator of their presence, and experienced clerics can often identify the substance at a glance.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Creating an Ectoplasmic Creature </b></br>\"Ectoplasmic\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as the base creature + 1.</p><p><b>Alignment:</b> Usually chaotic evil.</p><p><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor bonus changes as follows: Ectoplasm Size Natural </h5><h5><b>Armor Bonus:</b> Tiny or smaller +0 Small +1 Medium +2 Large +3 Huge +4 Gargantuan +6 Colossal +8 </h5><h5><b>Hit Dice:</b> Drop HD gained from class levels (minimum 1) and change racial Hit Dice to d8s. Ectoplasmic creatures use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).</p><p><b>Saves:</b> Base save bonuses for racial Hit Dice are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> An ectoplasmic creature loses the base creature's defensive abilities and gains DR 5/ slashing as well as all of the standard immunities and traits possessed by undead creatures.</p><p><b>Speed:</b> Winged ectoplasmic creatures can still fly, but their maneuverability drops to poor if initially any better.</p><p>If the base creature flew magically, so can the ectoplasmic creature. Retain all other movement types.</p><p><b>Attacks:</b> An ectoplasmic creature retains all natural weapons of the base creature. It gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the ectoplasmic creature's size.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Special Attacks:</b> An ectoplasmic creature retains all of the special attacks of the base creature. In addition, an ectoplasmic creature gains the following special attack.</p><p><i>Horrifying Ooze</i> (Su): Any creature that is struck by an ectoplasmic creature's slam attack must make a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the ectoplasmic creature's Hit Dice or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Abilities:</b> +2 Str, +2 Cha. An ectoplasmic creature has no Con or Int score, and its Wis and Cha become 10.</p><p><b>BAB:</b> An ectoplasmic creature's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its </h5><h5>Hit Dice.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> An ectoplasmic creature always treats Acrobatics, Climb, Perception, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.</p><p><b>Feats:</b> An ectoplasmic creature loses all feats possessed by the base creature and gains Toughness as a bonus feat.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Special Abilities:</b> An ectoplasmic creature loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. An ectoplasmic creature gains the ability to traverse the air as per the <i>air walk</i> spell as a constant effect, as well as the following special ability: <i>Phase Lurch</i> (Su): An ectoplasmic creature has the ability to pass through walls or material obstacles. In order to use this ability, the ectoplasmic creature must begin and end its turn outside of whatever wall or obstacle it is moving through. An ectoplasmic creature cannot move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Slimy mucus that lingers for 1 minute marks the spot on a wall where an ectoplasmic creature entered and exited it.</p><p><b>Treasure:</b> Ectoplasmic creatures generally have no treasure, unless the creature retains some material relics it cherished in life.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "AP 43", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or haunt (3-6)", "Ref": "0", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d8+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 11, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1506, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "0", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "12, touch 10, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ectoplasmic Human", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "1", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "1/2", "XP": 200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "phase lurch", "Saves": "Fort +0, Ref +0, Will +1", "Melee": "slam +3 (1d4+3 plus horrifying ooze)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
