These creatures generally sustain themselves on a diet of large game and other animals, but eat anything readily available, including humanoids if the opportunity presents itself. These creatures are generally solitary, so mating and reproduction information is unknown, though scholars assume these rituals mimic other serpentine creatures. Deathstrokes, because of their intelligence and cunning are often worshipped by scaly humanoids as gods or quasi-deities. The deathstroke does nothing to dismiss these beliefs as the worshippers keep it supplied with a steady supply of animal and humanoid sacrifices. Deathstroke serpents can reach lengths of 50 feet. Colorations may also vary depending on climate and habit, but most deathstrokes are dark green with mottled scales. Deathstroke serpents spend large parts of their days sleeping, being mostly active at night. Prey is often ambushed and killed, and then returned to the deathstroke's lair to be devoured. After feeding, deathstrokes can sleep for up to one week. A deathstroke serpent attacks by biting and grabbing its opponent. A grappled foe is quickly wrapped in its coils and constricted, while remaining foes are assaulted by the deathstroke's <i>lightning bolt</i>s and <i>blasphemy</i> spell-like abilities.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Undercommon", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(14d10+70 plus 14)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 33, Dex 13, Con 20, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4775, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics, +4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "25, touch 10, flat-footed 23", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Deathstroke Serpent", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +19, Climb +25, Knowledge (any) +8, Knowledge (arcana) +3, Knowledge (planes) +8, Knowledge (religion) +3, Perception +19, Stealth +7, Swim +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm lands and underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +10, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +24 (3d6+16/19-20 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Huge"}
