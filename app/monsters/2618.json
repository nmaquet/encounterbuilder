A living creature struck must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. Thereafter, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save each minute (10 rounds) or take 1 point of Strength damage. This cycle continues until the creature dies or receives a <i>remove disease</i> spell. A successful DC 20 Heal check or a <i>delay poison</i> spell slows the continuing damage to 1 point per hour. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Sickening Aura (Su)</b> As a free action, a fungus gargoyle can emanate an aura that smells like rotting vegetable matter in a 10-foot radius. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as they remain in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterwards. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Fungus gargoyles are thought to be gargoyles that have been transformed into their current state by an evil cult that pays reverence to various demons of slime, ooze, and fungus. These creatures are often found acting as guardians in temples dedicated to such demons.</p><p>Unlike normal plants, fungus gargoyles do not require food or air (they still require water however), but sometimes eat their fallen enemies simply for the sheer pleasure of doing so (usually only evil-aligned fungus gargoyles do this). A typical fungus gargoyle stands about 5 or 6 feet tall and weighs up to 200 pounds. Though its shape can vary, most resemble ugly winged humanoids.</p><p>Fungus gargoyles typically ambush their prey, standing motionless until their opponent moves close. The fungus gargoyles then leap to the attack, slashing with their claws. Most fungus gargoyles try to stay airborne during combat rather than fight on the ground.</p><p>Credit The Fungus Gargoyle originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Clark Peterson, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (can't speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or patch (5-10)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+21 plus 7)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 14, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2618, "SubType": "(fungus)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Power Attack, Iron Will, Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception, +2 Stealth (+8 in vegetation)", "AC": "17, touch 12, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Fungus Gargoyle", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +2, Perception +12, Stealth +10 (+18 in vegetation)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +4, Will +4", "Melee": "2 claws +9 (1d8+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
