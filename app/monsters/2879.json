The save DC is Charisma-based. Spines-injury; save Fort DC 13; <i>onset</i> 1 round; frequency constant; effect target takes a -10 penalty on Swim checks and cannot hold its breath. If forced underwater, the target must save each round (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 445) or drown. </h5><h5><b>Leaping Charge (Ex)</b> A black spot ignores rough terrain and gaps less than 10 feet wide when charging. Additionally, its charges do no provoke attacks of opportunity. </h5><h5><b>Spines (Ex)</b> A black spot's spines can swivel to face any approaching creature. Any creature that attacks a black spot urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack is automatically attacked by the black spot's spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can curse the target as well. </h5><h5><b>Stability (Ex)</b> All giant urchins and similar creatures-like black spots-receive a +8 bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Though not actually intelligent, black spots are terrifyingly adept at locating prey and potential threats, leaping forth from tide pools in great bounds to skewer their victims. However, the true danger of a black spot urchin comes not from its gnashing, star-shaped beak or its needle-pointed spines, but rather from its weird magical nature. Instead of simply poisoning those it punctures, a black spot urchin in fact curses them, inhibiting their ability to swim. How exactly black spots came by such a strange ability and what they gain from drowning their victims days or even years after first encountering them are anyone's guess, but sailors stung by one of the beasts often refuse to go to sea again for fear of their lives. A black spot urchin is typically several feet in diameter, but is mostly made of its long spines and so weighs only a few pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "none", "Source": "AP 56", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or cluster (2-5)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 1, Dex 13, Con 10, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2879, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics", "AC": "15, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Black Spot", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +9, Swim +3", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "", "CR": "1/2", "XP": 200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate or warm oceans or coastlines", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +3, Will +0", "Melee": "bite +4 (1d3-5), spines -2 (1d2-5 plus curse)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Tiny"}
