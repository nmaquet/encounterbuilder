The target creature can resist this attempt with a DC 22 Reflex save. On a failure, the target treats the urannag's space as difficult terrain, but cannot move out of that space or up more than 10 feet. Each round a creature remains encaged, it takes 2d6 slashing damage from the sharpened gears and blades thrashing and whirring inside the creature. A creature can escape being encaged by making a successful CMB check or Escape Artist check (DC = the urannag's CMD) as a full-round action, or can smash through a cage wall. These walls are AC 22, have hardness 10, and 22 hp-once a hole is smashed into a wall, it automatically repairs itself the next time the urannag encages a foe. The save DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Exposed Mechanisms (Ex)</b> Although an urannag is a construct, it can be damaged and harmed by the same methods used to disarm and disable traps. A DC 20 Disable Device check can be attempted against an urannag as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. On a successful check, the urannag takes damage equal to 3d6 + the character's total ranks in Disable Device and it must make a DC 16 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1 round (the damage bypasses the urannag's damage reduction). </h5><h5><b>Living Trap (Ex)</b> Defensive abilities that apply to traps (such as trap sense) apply against an urannag's attacks.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The strange urannag (ur-AWN-ag, the singular and plural are the same) has long vexed scholars who have argued whether or not the thing is a creature or merely a complex trap. In truth, it is a little bit of both-yet another unsettling example of how reality on the Abyss doesn't quite match mortal expectations. Behaviorally, an urannag acts similarly to an ambush predator, yet it has no need for sustenance and is driven to trap and flense prey simply out of an inborn sense of cruelty and sadism. <br><b>Construction</b><br> Most urannag are created spontaneously by the Abyss, but enterprising spellcasters have found methods to duplicate the construction of these strange creatures. An urannag's body is made of 2,000 pounds of iron, and its frame must be forged over an Abyssal heat source, which infuses the creature with its chaotic and evil urges. </h5><h5><b>URANNAG </b> <br><b>CL</b> 10th; <b>Price</b> 35,000 gp </h5><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION </b> </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>keen edge</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>planar binding</i>; <b>Skill</b> Craft (sculpture) DC 19; <b>Cost</b> 17,500 gp.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "The Worldwound", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, tangle (3-5), or menace (6-12)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 25, Dex 11, Con -, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4679, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Skill Focus (Perception), Skill Focus (Stealth), Weapon Focus (arms)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception, +8 Stealth (+20 in shallow water)", "AC": "22, touch 8, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Urannag", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Perception +18, Stealth +9 (+21 in shallow water)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any swamp", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "living trap", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +5", "Melee": "3 claws +17 (1d8+7 plus entrap)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Huge"}
