In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a caryatid column, with no saving throw, while <i>transmute mud to rock</i> heals all of its lost hit points. A <i>stone to flesh</i> spell does not actually change the column's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round. </h5><h5><b>Shatter Weapons (Ex)</b> Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or <i>shatter</i> into pieces. A magic weapon uses its own save bonus or that of the wielder, whichever is higher. If the weapon breaks, the caryatid column takes no damage from the attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>A caryatid column is akin to the stone golem in that it is a magical construct created by a spellcaster. Caryatid columns are always created for a specific defensive function. The caryatid column stands 7 feet tall and weighs around 1,500 pounds. The column always wields a weapon (usually a longsword) in its left hand. The weapon itself is constructed of steel, but is melded with the column and made of stone until the column animates. When melded, the sword is likely to be overlooked (DC 20 Perception check to see it).</p><p>Caryatid columns are programmed as guardians and activate when certain conditions or stipulations are met or broken (such as a living creature enters a chamber guarded by a caryatid column). A caryatid column attacks its opponents with its longsword. It does not move more than 50 feet from the area it is guarding or protecting.<br><b>Construction</b><br> A caryatid column's body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 1,500 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality, and costs 2,000 gp.<br><b>CARYATID COLUMN</b><br> <b>CL</b> 12th; <b>Price </b>17,000 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>lesser geas</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, <i>shatter</i>, creator must be caster level 12th; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Craft (sculptures) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 15; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>9,500 gp <br>Credit The Caryatid Column originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Jean Wells.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or troupe (6-11)", "Ref": "-1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2294, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 9, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Caryatid Column", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref -1, Will +0", "Melee": "type +6 (1d8+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
