This attack deals 4d8+19 points of damage, but allows the grappled creature a free attempt to escape the grapple. If a creature escapes, it is thrown 30 feet in a random direction by the zeuglodon's erratic thrashing.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The primordial zeuglodon is often mistaken for a dinosaur or other large reptile, in part because of its almost crocodilian mouth as well as its snake-like elongation. Despite these features, it is more closely related to whales and other cetaceans than either aquatic reptiles or fish. A zeuglodon moves through the water with a vertical anguiliform (eel-like) motion that seems almost to be a primitive version of the efficient fluke-driven locomotion of its cetacean relatives. Zeuglodons breathe air through blowholes on the tops of their heads, though they lack the lung capacity to stay underwater for as long as their more evolved kin. The relative dimensions of their angular heads are too small to encase the enlarged brains or melons developed by other cetaceans for echolocation or communication with others of their kind, and as such zeuglodons are less social than whales and dolphins. What they lack in specialized anatomy, however, they make up for in sheer ferocity and speed. A hunting zeuglodon is a furious foe to contend with. An adult zeuglodon measures around 50 feet long and weighs upward of 50,000 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "AP 60", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d8+66)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 37, Dex 18, Con 22, Int 1, Wis 13, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "20 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3333, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lunge, Power Attack, Run", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "25, touch 11, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Zeuglodon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +20, Swim +27", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm oceans", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "hold breath", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +11, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +17 (2d8+19 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Gargantuan"}
