A DC 13 Will save detects the ruse. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Uncanny Climber (Su)</b> A decapus can climb with ease, as if using <i>spider</i> climb. It can use the accelerated climb action to cover any distance up to four times its climb speed, with each check allowing it to climb a distance equal to its climb speed. Climbing a distance equal to or less than its climb speed is a move-equivalent action.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Decapuses are solitary creatures that dwell in dense forests or underground. Most prefer the forests as their ability to move among the trees allows them to either pursue their prey or flee in situations not to their advantage. On the ground, decapuses are slow-moving, thus they spend most of their time among the tree tops.</p><p>Decapuses are nocturnal hunters and are quite fond of human, elf, and halfling flesh. In times when food is scarce, they exist on a diet of rats, snakes, and other small forest creatures (or dungeon denizens in the case of the subterranean decapus).</p><p>Decapuses prefer a solitary life; the only time more than one will ever be encountered together is during mating season (usually the fall). Young decapuses are born live and the female only ever gives birth to a single young during each mating season. If food is extremely scarce, some decapus females have been known to eat their young.</p><p>This creature's body is a 4-foot diameter globe of pallid green. On rare occasions, a purple or even yellow hued decapus may be encountered. Patches of dark hair, brown or black, grow in various locations. Regardless of its body color, each decapus has 10 octopus-like tentacles protruding from its spherical body. Each tentacle is covered in suction cups that aid the creature in not only climbing and moving through trees, but also in holding on to its prey. Its large wide maw sports sickly yellow teeth and foul breath.</p><p>Decapuses seem to be able to speak with others of their kind using a series of guttural noises.</p><p>A decapus prefers to use its illusionary ability and sound mimicry ability to lure prey in close where it can strike with its tentacles. When its prey is within range, the creature drops from the trees, hanging from a tree limb with a single tentacle, and grabs and slashes with its remaining tentacles. A decapus can use only three tentacles against a single foe.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Decapus", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Revised", "Land": "1", "Organization": "Solitary (or rarely, a mated pair)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.
