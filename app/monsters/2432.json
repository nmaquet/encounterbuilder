A balban deals double damage against an object or structure. </h5><h5><b>Pound (Ex)</b> A balban that makes a successful grapple check against a foe smaller than itself can smash the opponent into nearby solid objects (walls, floor, ground, etc.) as a standard action. This deals 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. Further, the victim must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. A balban can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Almost as stupid as the lowly dretches, balbans are hulking monstrosities standing over 10 feet tall. Demonic generals use these creatures in abundance in their armies, relying on the balban's love for battle, their great strength, and their knack for destroying objects and structures. Balban squads are brutish, hulking, and hard to control. While many demon lords do employ their services, they are deemed highly expendable and are thus encountered on the front lines of any great battle.</p><p>Balbans spend much of their life battling, not necessarily for survival, but simply because they relish the chaos and bloodshed combat brings.</p><p>Balbans attack any creature they encounter on sight, except those they know are more powerful than themselves. Though lacking in the intelligence department, they do not attack any demonic officer in the service of a demon lord (unless they know the officer is weaker and they can kill him or her and make it look like something else was responsible).</p><p>Balbans have slate gray skin, stand at least 12 feet tall and weigh about 4,500 pounds. Their eyes are coal black and their tongues violet.</p><p>A seemingly constant stream of saliva and gastric juices oozes from their mouths.</p><p>A balban employs simple tactics in battle; smash an opponent, grab an opponent, pound it into pulp, and devour what's left. Against weaker foes they are likely to employ their ability to <i>cause fear</i> or confuse opponents by shrouding themselves in <i>darkness</i>.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or band (3-8)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+54)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 14, Con 23, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2432, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, Weapon Focus, Great Fortitude", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 11, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Balban Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +13, Knowledge (planes) +10, Perception +14, Survival +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +5, Will +8", "Melee": "2 slam +16 (2d6+8), bite +16 (1d8+8)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
