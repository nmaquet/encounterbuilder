They make their lairs wherever they can on their endless plane; using dead planar travelers (that aren't devoured), bits of planar refuse, bits of solid matter, and anything else they can cobble together. An astral spider's lair can stretch over several hundred feet. A typical lair contains a single female astral spider who several times a year lays up to 30 eggs at a time. These eggs are wrapped tightly in the spider's webs and attached to some part of the lair. Within 6-8 weeks, the eggs hatch, the newborn astral spiders using their sharpened mandibles to tear through the eggs and webbing. Most hatchlings don't survive, being eaten by other astral spiders, astral sharks, or some other denizen of the plane. Those that do reach adulthood, journey off into the Astral Plane a few months after hatching. Astral spiders sustain themselves on a diet of other creatures, particularly astral sharks and planar travelers. When food is scarce, an astral spider can enter a state of semi-hibernation, remaining motionless in its web without food for months at a time. An astral spider is about 8 feet long with a glossy silver body covered in tiny, dancing black streaks. Its ten legs are glossy silver and its eyes appear as small dots of black ink. The creature's mandibles are slightly oversized and dull silver in color. Its underside is dull silver, fading to a dull grayish-silver near the spider's rear legs. Older astral spiders have completely gray undersides. An astral spider rarely initiates combat and simply lies in wait, motionless, in its webs. When it detects movement, it scuttles out and attacks. In combat, an astral spider rears on its back six legs and slashes its foes with its front four legs, following quickly with its deadly bite. Particularly bothersome opponents are webbed and immobilized with the spider moving into bite its trapped foe quickly. Slain prey and webbed prey are carried back to its lair and fed to the young. Portions of the prey not devoured are webbed and worked into solid makeup of the lair.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or band (2-5)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(11d10+44)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4734, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Lunge, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+12 Climb, +4 Perception, +4 Stealth (+8 in webs)", "AC": "22, touch 12, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Astral Spider", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +25, Perception +25, Stealth +17 (+21 in webs)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Astral Plane)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "strong webs", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +12, Will +6", "Melee": "4 legs +15 (1d6+5), bite +15 (1d8+5 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., climb 40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
