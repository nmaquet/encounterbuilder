As long as it's within 10 feet of some sort of stone, a lythic can hide itself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. </h5><h5><b>Earth Glide (Su)</b> A lythic can glide through stone, dirt or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell cast on an area containing a burrowing lythic flings the lythic back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. </h5><h5><b>Fury of the Earth (Su)</b> Anytime a lythic suffers more than 50% of its normal hit points in damage in a single encounter, it flies into a berserker-like rage. This grants the lythic a bonus to its damage rolls equal to one-half its Hit Dice for the remainder of the encounter. It cannot end this fury voluntarily but continues until all opponents are defeated or have fled.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Lythics are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. There, they spend their time in huge underground caverns with others of their race or in the company of earth elementals. Some lythics serve the elder elemental lords as spies, using their skills of going unnoticed to sneak into the palaces of arch-rivals.</p><p>Lythics occasionally punch through a vortex or portal and wind up on the Material Plane. Other outer planes (save some of the more desolate Abyssal planes) hold no interest for the lythic. On the Material Plane, they spend their time underground or gliding through mountains, devouring minerals as they move along. Occasionally, a lythic's elemental master sends it on a mission into the Material Plane.</p><p>Lythics are not particularly fond of pechs and generally avoid them or attack on sight. They rarely associate with other elemental creatures.</p><p>Lythic are not particularly hostile unless threatened. When a party of would-be delvers enters its domain, the lythic often trails them by blending with surrounding stone. If detected, a lythic usually flees unless attacked. Once in combat however, a lythic rarely backs down, and often fights until it is killed or its opponents are dead or fleeing.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Terran", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 12, Con 15, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2788, "SubType": "(earth, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in rocky areas", "AC": "18, touch 11, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lythic", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +9, Escape Artist +10, Knowledge (dungeoneering) +9, Perception +11, Sense Motive +11, Stealth +13 (+21 in rocky areas)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Elemental Plane of Earth", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "blend with stone, earth glide", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "2 slams +9 (1d4+3)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., burrow 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
