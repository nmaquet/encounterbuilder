If a swallowed creature successfully cuts its way out of a dwiergeth, it must attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save as it crawls out of the hole. If the victim is successful, it escapes the creature, but on a failure, the victim merely crawls from one extradimensional intestine to another and must endure another round of being swallowed whole. A dwiergeth can continue to use swallow whole even after a creature cuts its way out. A creature casting any teleport-based spell or spell-like ability while within 5 feet of a dwiergeth must make a successful DC 21 Will save or the teleportation effect instead sends the target into the dwiergeth's forever gullet. When a dwiergeth is under the effects of <i>dimensional anchor</i> or in an area that prohibits extradimensional travel, it loses the abilities of its forever gullet, but its swallow whole ability functions normally. The save DC is Charisma-based, and it has a +2 racial bonus.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Dwiergeths hunt the Worldwound's deadly rift valleys, feasting on demon flesh as readily as any other meat, digesting prey in a gnawing process of transdimensional rumination. Sure-footed dwiergeths leap and sprint along vertical surfaces with disturbing ease, and often cling to a cliffside for hours or even days, waiting for prey to approach from either above or below. They have a supernatural mastery over the wind as well, and make use of their spell-like abilities to cause climbers to fall from cliffs or flying creatures to be dashed against rocky walls-it's easier to eat bleeding, broken meat, after all. A dwiergeth's anatomy is quite unusual. Trembling bristles protruding from the creature's flesh act as eyes, allowing it to see in all directions at once, but the monster's strangest feature lies within. Although dissection of a slain dwiergeth reveals a single coiling digestive tract filled with sharp teeth winding from one of its mouths through its bulbous body to the other mouth, the entrails of a living dwiergeth actually extend into other strange dimensions generated by the monster's Abyssal heritage.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal", "Source": "The Worldwound", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (3-6)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(13d8+117)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 32, Dex 25, Con 28, Int 5, Wis 24, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4674, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Critical (bites), Improved Initiative, Mobility, Spring Attack, Wind Stance", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "28, touch 17, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Dwiergeth", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +37, Perception +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "15", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +11, Will +15", "Melee": "2 bites +19 (4d6+11/19-20 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "60 ft., climb 60 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
