Though its appearance lends to the fa\u00e7ade of being a slow moving lizard, it is in fact, rather graceful and quick. Those that make the mistake of assuming the gnasher is slow-moving rarely live to tell others of their mistake.</p><p>Gnasher lizards make their lairs in stony areas, typically forest clearings or mountain terrain, usually near (within several hundred feet if possible) a water source. They are carnivorous creatures and highly territorial, even attacking their own kind if one gnasher lizard intrudes upon the territory of another. Gnashers are solitary creatures and only come together to mate (during the spring or early summer months). Mating season is the only time more than one of these creatures is encountered together, and once the mating ritual is ended, each goes its own way. The female lays a clutch of 1d4+2 eggs which hatch within 3 months. Young reach maturity within 8 months and are left to their own devices.</p><p>A gnasher lizard is typically 10 feet long but can grow to a length of 20 feet or more. A typical gnasher weighs about 1,000 pounds. Though most are stone gray, some variants encountered have been colored greenishbrown or black. Its long fang-like teeth are razor-sharp and it uses these to tear its prey into pieces.</p><p>Gnasher lizards typically attack from ambush, using their surroundings to conceal themselves and springing out at the last second to catch their opponents by surprise. Gnashers attack any creature that wanders into their territory, including those larger than themselves, relying on their vorpal bite to quickly dispatch such creatures.</p><p>When it swallows a foe, a gnasher lizard typically holds it in its stomach for several rounds before regurgitating it into its mouth, snapping down on it with its razor-sharp teeth and then swallowing it again.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+50)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 16, Con 20, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2786, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "21, touch 12, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gnasher Lizard", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +16, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests and mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +8, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +17 (2d10+10 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
