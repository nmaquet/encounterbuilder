In this form, it can run on top of water (including deep water such as rivers and lakes) and marshy ground as if it were solid, flat terrain. The boobrie is still marsh bound in this form and suffers the normal penalties if it moves too far from its environment. </h5><h5><b>Marsh Bound (Ex)</b> A boobrie can survive away from its marshy home for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, refer to the drowning rules. </h5><h5><b>Wail (Su)</b> Once every 2d4 rounds as a standard action, a boobrie can emit an eerie wail that deals 4d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures within 40 feet that hear it. A DC 18 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Further, a creature failing its save is paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting attack. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the wail of that boobrie for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus from the boobrie's Ability Focus feat.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The boobrie, or marsh terror, is a quick-moving, malign, flightless bird found haunting desolate and overgrown swamps, wetlands, and marshes. It is carnivorous by nature and feasts on a diet of crocodile meat, fish, and humans (the last of which is one of its favorite meals). When food is scarce, boobrie flocks often war with each other, eating the fallen and the slain. A boobrie flock dwells in thick, overgrown (and usually well-hidden) marsh groves. A typical flock consists of more males than females and a number of young equal to the combined total of adult boobries. A single dominate male acts as the leader of the flock and commands the others of the flock in carrying out particular tasks. Boobrie flocks sometimes settle near (but not too near) human settlements and conduct raids into the settlements, stealing livestock, children, and even lone adults. Boobries speak broken Common and their own language of hoots, croaks, and clicks. Boobries are vicious creatures with voracious appetites. They are almost always hungry and usually attack prey on sight. A boobrie attacks with two sharpened talons and a nasty bite from its serrated bill. Slain prey is dragged to the lair and given to the young who promptly tear it to shreds, devouring as much of the kill as they can. Leftovers are simply discarded and left to rot or discarded for other scavengers to claim.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or flock (3-6 plus 100% noncombatants)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+18)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 3, Wis 14, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4754, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (wail), Alertness, Improved Critical (claw), Power Attack, Swim-By Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 11, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Boobrie", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Perception +8, Stealth +7, Swim +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious, change shape", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +8, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +11 (1d8+3/19-20), bite +11 (2d6+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
