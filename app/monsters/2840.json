Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the character has coughed up enough water to shake the effects of this attack and takes no further damage. An affected creature can take no actions other than to defend itself in any round it takes damage from this ability. At 0 or less hit points, the victim falls unconscious. In the next round, he drowns. The save DC is Charisma-based. Holding one's breath does not prevent drowning (water is already in the lungs). A <i>remove curse</i>, <i>heal</i> spell, or successful DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the creature reaches 0 or less hit points. </h5><h5><b>Despair (Su)</b> At the mere sight of a mummy of the deep, the viewer must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that mummy of the deep's despair ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A mummy of the deep is an undead creature that lairs in the depths of the sea.
