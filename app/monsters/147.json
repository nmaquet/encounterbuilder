Drow favor an insidious toxin that causes its victims to lapse into unconsciousness- this poison allows drow to capture slaves with great ease. Drow Poison-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/minute for 2 minutes; initial effect unconsciousness for 1 minute; secondary effect unconsciousness for 2d4 hours; cure 1 save. Although related to the elves, the drow are a vile and evil cousin at best. Sometimes called dark elves, these cunning creatures prowl the caves and tunnels of the world below, ruling vast subterranean cities through fear and might. Worshiping demons and enslaving most races they encounter, the drow are among the underworld's most feared and hated denizens.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Drow are shorter and a bit more slender than their surface-dwelling kin, but they are otherwise physically similar. Drow have dark skin, ranging from black to a hazy purple hue. Most drow have white or silver hair and white or red eyes, but other colors are not unheard of.</p><p>Drow society is ruled over by powerful nobility, themselves governed by sadistic and dangerous matriarchs who constantly plot and scheme against rival houses and lesser kin within their own families. The majority of drow are the common soldiers and decadent citizenry, with base stats as presented here-drow nobles are more powerful and dangerous, and are detailed on the facing page.</p><p>In combat, drow are thoroughly ruthless, with little regard for fairness or mercy. They prefer to attack from ambush or to lure enemies into situations where they clearly have the upper hand. If things turn against them, drow are quick to flee, leaving slaves and minions to cover their escape.</p><p><b>Drow Characters</b><br> Drow are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All drow have the following racial traits.</p><p><b>+2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution:</b> Drow are nimble and manipulative.</p><p><b>Medium:</b> Drow are Medium creatures, and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</p><p><b>Normal Speed:</b> Drow have a base speed of 30 feet.</p><p><b>Darkvision:</b> Drow can see in the dark up to 120 feet.</p><p><b>Drow Immunities:</b> Drow are immune to magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial bonus to saves against enchantment spells.</p><p><b>Keen Senses:</b> Drow receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.</p><p><b><b>Spell Resistance:</b></b> Drow possess spell resistance equal to 6 plus their class levels.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> A drow can cast dancing lights, darkness, and faerie fire each once per day, using his total character level as his caster level.</p><p><b>Light Blindness:</b> Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds drow for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.</p><p><b>Poison Use:</b> See Special Abilities, above.</p><p><b>Weapon Familiarity:</b> Drow are proficient with the hand crossbow, rapier, and short sword.</p><p><b>Languages:</b> Drow begin play speaking Elven and Undercommon. Drow with high Intelligence can choose bonus languages from the following: Abyssal, Aklo, Aquan, Common, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, or Goblin.</p><p><b>Drow Nobility</b><br> About one out of every 20 drow is gifted with special powers from birth-the overwhelming majority of these exceptional drow are female, and as a result, drow society tends to be matriarchal in nature. These special births are engineered and encouraged among the ruling caste, and are far more likely to occur when the mother is of noble heritage.</p><p>Strangely, the status of the father seems not to increase or decrease the chances of a child being born a drow noble.</p><p>Common drow children born to nobles are usually put to death-sacrificed to one of the many demon gods to whom the drow offer worship. It is rare for a drow noble to be born to common parents, but those who are usually murder their parents or family before they come of age in order to hide the truth of their base upbringing and to ease the processes of joining one of their society's noble houses.</p><p>Drow nobles are more powerful than the majority of their kin, and as such they quickly rise to power within their houses. Advancement through the hierarchy of a drow noble house is usually accomplished through a combination of assassination, seduction, and treachery, leading most drow in power to be overly paranoid.</p><p>Drow Noble Characters Drow nobles are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. A drow noble's challenge rating is equal to her class level. Drow nobles possess all of the racial traits listed above for drow characters, plus the following.</p><p><b>+4 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution.</b> Noble drow are very agile, observant, and regal. These ability score modif iers replace the standard drow ability score modif iers.</p><p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Drow nobles have spell resistance equal to 11 + their character level.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> Drow nobles can cast dancing lights, deeper darkness, faerie fire, feather fall, and levitate each at will, and have detect magic as a constant spell-like ability. A drow noble can also cast divine favor, dispel magic, and suggestion once per day each. In some cases, a drow noble's spell-like abilities might vary, although the level of a particular spelllike ability does not. A drow noble's caster level for her spell-like abilities is equal to her character level.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Elven, Undercommon", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "pair, squad (3-4), patrol (5-8), or war party (10-40)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 11, Dex 15, Con 10, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "hand crossbow +3 (1d4/19-20 plus poison)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "1", "id": 147, "SubType": "(elf )", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "warrior 1", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception", "AC": "15, touch 12, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Drow", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +2, Stealth +2", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-1", "Race": "Drow", "CR": "1/3", "XP": 135, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "1", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "poison use", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +2, Will -1; +2 vs. enchantment", "Melee": "rapier +2 (1d6/18-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
