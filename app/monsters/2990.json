Its body scales are thickened and hardened, which slows it somewhat in water but provides good protection. The serpent's most outstanding features, however, are the rows of long, sharp teeth that fill its mouth. It has large, lidless red eyes with white pupils.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Fanged Sea Serpent</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 6</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>2,400</h5><h5>N Large dragon (aquatic)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+1; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, scent; Perception +9</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>24, touch 10, flat-footed 23 (+1 Dex, +14 natural, -1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>76 (8d12+24)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+9, <b>Ref </b>+7, <b>Will </b>+6</h5><h5><b>Immune </b>paralysis and sleep, dragon traits</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>swim 30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +12 (1d8+6 plus poison)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>10 ft.; <b>Reach </b>5 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>constrict (1d8+6), poison</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>18, <b>Dex </b>13, <b>Con </b>16, <b>Int </b> 5, <b>Wis </b>11, <b>Cha </b>6</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+8; <b>CMB </b>+13; <b>CMD </b>24 (can't be tripped)</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Cleave, Great Cleave, Power Attack, Swim-By Attack<sup>B</sup>, Weapon Focus (bite)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Perception +9, Stealth +6, Survival +9, Swim +21</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any aquatic</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary, pair or swarm (3-20)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>none</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div></h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 17; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Con; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s.

Fanged sea serpents are nomadic, traveling with ocean currents.</p><p>They prefer to hunt in groups, which they can surround and attack from all sides. Fanged sea serpents have been known to attack their own kind, but only when starving.</p><p>Fanged sea serpents on their own usually live on large fish, and avoids confronting intelligent opposition unless they believe their victims to be helpless. However, when they are in groups, they become much more aggressive, and attack creatures much larger than themselves. They prefer to use swarm tactics, surrounding their target and attacking simultaneously from all directions; in the water, where they can also attack from above and below, few marine creatures can stand up to a prolonged assault.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Patrick Lawinger.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary, pair or swarm (3-20)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d12+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 13, Con 16, Int 5, Wis 11, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2990, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Great Cleave, Power Attack, Swim-By AttackB, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "24, touch 10, flat-footed 23", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Fanged Sea Serpent", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +9, Stealth +6, Survival +9, Swim +21", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +7, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +12 (1d8+6 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
