Elementals receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day. Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control, obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals. Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma check to gain control of the elemental. </h5><h5><b>Drench (Ex)</b> Lypso's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller. He can <i>dispel magic</i>al fire he touches as <i>dispel magic</i> (CL 20th). </h5><h5><b>Vortex (Su)</b> Lypso can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack, but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water. </h5><h5><b>Water Mastery (Ex)</b> Lypso gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both he and his opponent are touching water. If the opponent or Lypso is touching the ground, Lypso takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether Lypso is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Lypso rules over water elementals and those who call the Plane of Water home. His lair is a massive cavern deep within the Plane of Water. His court consists of water elementals, water weirds, and marid. His most trusted advisor is a marid of ancient age and power. Lypso keeps an \"aviary\" of water mephitis for his amusement as well. Legends tell of a great enmity between Lypso and Inder, the Lord of Fire Elementals, and that a great elemental war is brewing between the two. This same legend reveals that Lypso and Inder are brothers. Whether this is truth or not is currently unknown. In combat, Lypso uses his vortex attack and <i>horrid wilting</i> attack to begin battle. Creatures that survive are subjected to his <i>ice storm</i> ability as well as a pummeling by his powerful slam attacks. If outclassed, Lypso summons water creatures, or a small army of sahuagin to his aid.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Auran, Common, Ignan, Terran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or band (Lypso plus 2-4 greater water elementals)", "Ref": "31", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(40d10+320)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 43, Dex 25, Con 27, Int 22, Wis 24, Cha 24", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4817, "SubType": "(elemental, extraplanar, water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Critical Focus, Dodge, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (slam), Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Improved Vital Strike, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Power Attack, Spring Attack, SwimBy Attack, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "Lord Of Water Elementals", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "32", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "32, touch 16, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Lypso", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +50, Diplomacy +47, Escape Artist +47, Intimidate +50, Knowledge (arcana) +49, Knowledge (planes) +49, Knowledge (religion) +49, Perception +50, Sense Motive +50, Stealth +42, Survival +47, Swim +67", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "22", "Race": "", "CR": "23", "XP": 820000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Water)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +32, Ref +31, Will +22", "Melee": "2 slams +55 (4d6+16/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 100 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
