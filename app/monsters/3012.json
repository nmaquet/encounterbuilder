It gains +4 Strength and -4 AC while raging. The skin stitcher cannot end its rage voluntarily. Note that the skin stitcher does not drop its chains while raging. </h5><h5><b>Skin Scent (Ex)</b> The skin stitcher can detect any living creature that possesses natural skin to a distance of one-half mile. This includes all creature types, in most cases, except plants, elementals, oozes, constructs, vermin, and many undead (undead with flesh, such as zombies, can be detected by a skin stitcher, but skeletons cannot).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A skin stitcher is a malevolent and violent creature that kills for food, pleasure, and the skin of humanoids (which it keeps and collects). While it is known to eat just about anything it kills, it only keeps the skin and flesh of humanoid creatures. Other creatures are devoured, flesh and all.</p><p>Skin stitchers collect the flesh and skin of any humanoid creature slain.</p><p>From this, they weave intricate clothes and coverings that they wear over their entire body. At a distance, the skin stitcher can pass for a normal humanoid when wearing one of these \"skin suits\" (Perception check DC 20 to reveal its true identity). Up close, the skin stitcher's disguise becomes much less effective, making it appear as a humanoid with a heavily scarred and stitched together body.</p><p>The skin stitcher stands about 6 feet tall and (in its true form) appears as a skinless humanoid. Its natural body appears to be bone wrapped tightly with corded muscle and covered with a dark red-purplish slime. Its eye sockets are deep and contain large bulbous eyes with blue irises. The skin stitcher's long, lanky arms end in claws as do its thick, muscled legs. It carries two large chains covered with many sharpened barbs.</p><p>Though their hands are clawed, skin stitchers prefer to attack using large chains covered with razor-sharp barbs. These not only aid in killing a foe, but also help strip the flesh from a victim. Skin stitchers often attack from ambush, attempting to gain the upper hand over their prey as quickly as possible. Slain opponents are skinned and then eaten or carried to the skin stitcher's lair and devoured later.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+14)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 14, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "spiked chain", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3012, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (spiked chain)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 12, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Skin Stitcher", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +13, Intimidate +8, Perception +11, Stealth +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land and underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +4, Will +6", "Melee": "spiked chain +9 (2d4+4/x3) or 2 claws +8 (1d4+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
