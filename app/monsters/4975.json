They are believed to be the result of diabolical experiments that crossed giant black widows with devils. These creatures, while possibly related to black widows, are much more cunning and intelligent. Hellwidows dwell on the warmer planes of Hell's layers, generally avoiding the colder lower planes. Giant web-filled caverns serve as their lairs. When encountered on the Material Plane, it is most often in thick forests or caverns in warmer climates. Evil spellcasters occasionally summon a hellwidow to the Material Plane and strike a bargain with the creature offering food, treasure, or the like in return for some service (usually guarding a location or killing a particular enemy). Hellwidows are roughly 9 feet long and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds, with males being slightly smaller than females. Hellwidows mate several times per year with the female laying up to 100 eggs in a single dull gray egg sac. The eggs hatch within 30 days, with only about 25% of the young surviving. Young are blood red in color with dull yellow stripes on their abdomens. Young mature rapidly, reaching adulthood within six months. Hellwidows are carnivores and prey on various types of other creatures, including lesser devils, fiendish insects, and even other hellwidows. Prey is quickly cocooned in the hellwidow's webbing, set on fire, and then bitten repeatedly until it succumbs to the widow's poison. Once the prey is dead, the hellwidow carries it back to its lair to be devoured. Hellwidows prefer to hunt by ambush; usually hiding in dark corners within their webs. When they detect movement, such as a creature becoming entangled in their webs, they quickly move to strike.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Infernal (can't speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-6)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(10d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 7, Wis 15, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4975, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Skill Focus (Stealth), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "22, touch 12, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Hellwidow", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +22, Perception +8, Stealth +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Nine Hells)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +12, Will +5", "Melee": "bite +17 (2d8+10 plus 1d6 fire and poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Large"}
