Other sages dispute these claims and believe the hedon are the result of a curse laid on an entire community of fey creatures by a vengeful annis or hag. Hedons are malevolent and violent fey creatures that dwell in darkened forests found on the fringes of civilization. They take great delight in tormenting travelers and townsfolk and always lair near heavily traveled roads or paths and communities. Many hedons sneak into nearby towns under the cover of darkness and slaughter livestock or kidnap children (because they are easier to carry and control than adults). Hedons lair in caverns, caves, or nests built from branches, straw, twigs, and so on. Lairs are always kept well hidden away from prying eyes and are difficult to locate by all but the best of scouts and trackers. A typical hedon lair contains 2-4 adults and an equal number of noncombatant young. Mating season for hedons is year round and the female lays a clutch of 1d4 eggs. The eggs hatch after about 3 months and young reach maturity within 2 or 3 years. A hedon appears as a tan-skinned elf with the lower torso of a hawk or falcon. It rarely wears clothes, but should it choose to do so (and some do, especially to hide their appearance when they attempt to move through a populated area without drawing undue attention to themselves), it usually dons a long hooded cloak or robe of green, gray, or brown. Hedons rarely carry weapons, preferring to fight with their claws. A hedon attacks with its spell-like abilities, targeting the strongest perceived foes first. It quickly follows this barrage with melee by grabbing its foe and raking with its clawed feet.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan, speak with animals", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d6+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4974, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 12, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Hedon", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +8, Escape Artist +8, Knowledge (nature) +6, Perception +8, Perform (dancing) +8, Stealth +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +2 (1d4+1 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
