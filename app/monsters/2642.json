No one is quite sure of their true origin and some sages believe they may have traveled to the Material Plane from another dimension or time. They are solitary creatures and favor humanoid prey above all others, though they are not adverse to attacking and devouring any living creature encountered.</p><p>A gohl is a 10-foot wide, 10-foot high, blob of mottled black and gray flesh, slimy and rubbery to the touch. Each of its three heads is gold with red eyes and has a wide mouth lined with double rows of needle-sharp teeth. Each neck is scaled gold and turns to dark green as it nears the gohl's body. The underside of each neck is slightly lighter in color.</p><p>Gohls communicate with others of their kind by changing the color of their trunk. In combat, a gohl can release a loud, metallic-sounding roar from one of its heads and often does so, in an effort to scare its adversaries.</p><p>Gohl's make no effort to disguise themselves or hide from opponents. As soon as intruders are detected in their area, they move to intercept them.</p><p>The gohl begins combat by grabbing a foe with a tentacle. A grabbed foe is subjected to as many bite attacks each round as the gohl can bring against it. Multiple opponents are often grabbed and bitten as well. Foes that are killed by a gohl are carried to its lair and digested.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (can't speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(14d8+56)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 17, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2642, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Multiattack, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "22, touch 12, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gohl", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +9, Intimidate +10, Knowledge (dungeoneering) +5, Perception +25", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "12", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +9, Will +12", "Melee": "3 bites +15 (1d4+5 plus 1d6 acid), 6 tentacles +12 (1d6+2 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 30 ft.
