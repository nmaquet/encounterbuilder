This communication is limited to simple concepts, such as \"come here,\" \"defend me,\" or \"attack this target.\"</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Ravenous and cruel, the sahuagin are, unfortunately, among the most prosperous oceanic races. Great cities raised by these creatures darken the deep ocean trenches, and many are the near-coastal fortresses where they launch endless raids against their air-breathing enemies who dwell in close proximity to the shore. Warlike and proud, the sahuagin rarely ally with others, and view most other aquatic races such as the aboleths, the merfolk, and their ilk as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect and adore apart from their own kind are sharks, for in these relentless predators the sahuagin see much of themselves. A sahuagin stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds.</p><p>Sahuagin are prone to beneficial mutations, and when a mutant is born it almost always rises to the society's nobility or rulership. The most common sahuagin mutation is an extra pair of arms (granting two additional claw attacks or the opportunity to wield more weapons).</p><p>Rumors speak of the rare malenti-sahuagin who look not like sharkmen but aquatic elves, yet who share their kin's bloodlusts and cruel natures. Malenti often serve as spies and assassins for sahuagin rulers, but rumors of allmalenti tribes in isolated reaches of the sea persist.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common; speak with sharks", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "Solitary, pair, team (5-8), patrol (11-20 plus 1 lieutenant of 3rd level and 1-2 sharks), band (20-80 plus 100% noncombatants, 1 lieutenant of 3rd level and 1 chieftain of 4th level per 20 adults, and 1-2 sharks), or tribe (70-160 plus 100% noncombatants, 1 lieutenant of 3rd level per 20 adults, 1 chieftain of 4th level per 40 adults, 9 guards of 4th level, 1-4 underpriestesses of 3rd-6th level, 1 priestess of 7th level, 1 baron of 6th-8th level, and 5-8 sharks)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d10+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 14, Wis 13, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "heavy crossbow +3 (1d10/19-20)", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 308, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 11, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Sahuagin", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Handle Animal +1, Perception +6, Ride +6, Stealth +6, Survival +6, Swim +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate or warm ocean", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +4, Will +4", "Melee": "trident +4 (1d8+3), bite -1 (1d4+1) or 2 claws +4 (1d4+2), bite +4 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Medium"}
