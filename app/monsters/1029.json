The ink provides total concealment in water, and persists for 1 minute. If used out of the water, the jet of ink is a line 30 feet long, and creatures in the area must make a Reflex save (DC 16) or be blinded for 1 round. The DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Tojanidas are bizarre natives of the Plane of Water that resemble crosses between monstrous crabs and enormous snapping turtles.</p><p>Originally elemental beings of water, possibly related to marid genies, tojanidas were bound into their current forms long ago for unclear reasons, and no longer know how they might eventually return to their pure and formless state. Determined to preserve their pride, the grotesque tojanidas ply the waters of the planes seeking hedonistic pleasures-especially culinary ones-and the adoration of other races. Loquacious when addressed with the proper respect, they make excellent heralds and emissaries for more powerful beings, and often enjoy posing as such even when operating on their own. When riled, however, tojanidas make fearsome opponents, nigh-unstoppable juggernauts with snapping jaws and clacking pincers.</p><p>Adult tojanidas are roughly 6 feet long, and weigh several hundred pounds. When threatened, a tojanida can retract its limbs most of the way into its shell, which is an irremovable part of its body. The ring of eyes completely encircling the tojanida's shell along its equator makes the creature extremely difficult to catch by surprise, though it does retain small blind spots both directly above and directly below its body. While tojanidas adore eating, as they find flavor and texture to be two of the most fascinating senses, they don't actually need to consume food, instead drawing sustenance directly from the magic of their shells. Blessed (or cursed) with extremely long racial memories, tojanidas wander the oceans and lakes of innumerable worlds, attempting to find unusual physical pleasures or conversation capable of distracting them from the insufferable ennui and apathy born of remembering their ancestors' experiences. Though the tojanidas themselves may not appreciate the burden of memory, adventurers and scholars can sometimes make good use of a tojanida's recalled lore.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan", "Source": "Misfit Monsters", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, clutch (2-5), or cult (1 tojanida plus 2-12 humanoid followers)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+18)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 13, Con 17, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.; 10 ft. with tentacle (see below)", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1029, "SubType": "(extraplanar, water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Dodge, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "21, touch 12, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Tojanida", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +5, Escape Artist +10, Knowledge (planes) +9, Perception +14, Perform (act) +5, Sense Motive +10, Stealth +7, Survival +7, Swim +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic (Plane of Water)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +6, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +9 (1d6+3), 2 claws +9 (1d6+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., swim 90 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
