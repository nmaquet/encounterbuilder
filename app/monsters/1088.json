These determine the draconal's breath weapon, the additional energy damage of its claw and bite attacks, additional resistances and immunities, and its additional domain choices (see Spells, below). </h5><h5><b>Divine Insight (Su)</b> A draconal adds its Charisma bonus as an insight bonus to Armor Class. </h5><h5><b>Protective Aura (Su)</b> Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the draconal. Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals draconal's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a draconal's stat block.) </h5><h5><b>Spells</b> Draconals cast spells as 17th-level clerics. Like clerics, they have access to two domains, selecting from the following list: Air, Good, Nobility, Weather, and two additional domain options based on their color (see facing page). The majority of draconals choose Good and Nobility as their domains (as represented by this stat block). Draconals have a domain spell slot at each spell level but do not gain the granted powers of their chosen domains, nor do they gain access to other cleric abilities.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Draconals are mighty agathion lords, few in number and greatly removed from mortal affairs. They watch over powerful magic and are direct agents of the gods and the needs of the good planes. Patient and ageless, they plan for the long term, which often frustrates mortal creatures who seek to gain their assistance with a threat in the here and now. A draconal would rather support or enhance a group of heroes than tackle a problem directly, maintaining its focus on planar matters. Draconals are attuned to nature and believe in cycles of life and death. Though they are good, they understand that the presence of evil gives good creatures something to strive against, preventing stagnation and complacency. This means their outlook sometimes appears almost neutral, though they hate suffering and needless death. <br><b>DRACONAL COLORS </b><br> A draconal's coloration represents mystical elements relating to energy, life, and the natural world. These colors are normally chromatic rather than metallic, and an ignorant person seeing a draconal's colors may mistake her for an evil half-dragon. However, some draconals have metallic or gem-like coloration; for example, a yellow draconal may appear mustard yellow or metallic gold, while a white draconal may be chalk white, pearlescent white, or metallic silver. Draconals can change their coloration after a lengthy period of meditation, but normally only do this in response to some horrible evil that requires their direct intervention. This change affects the draconals' personality, and may alter their physical shape or apparent gender. <i>Black</i>: <i>Black</i> is a balance between male and female energy, and represents the sky, stars, immortality, and leadership. <i>Black</i> draconals are immune to fire damage, and their breath weapon is fire. A black draconal adds Fire, Glory, and Luck to its list of possible domains. <i>Green</i>: <i>Green</i> is s<i>light</i>ly skewed toward masculinity. It represents wood, plants, and flowers. <i>Green</i> draconals are immune to cold damage, and their breath weapon is cold. A green draconal adds Animal, Plant, and Water to its list of possible domains. <i>Red</i>: <i>Red</i> is a strongly masculine color, and most red draconals are male or have aggressive or gregarious personalities. <i>Red</i> represents fire, <i>light</i>, and warding against bad luck. <i>Red</i> draconals are immune to fire damage, and their breath weapon is fire. A red draconal adds Fire, Protection, and Sun to its list of possible domains. <i>White</i>: <i>White</i> is s<i>light</i>ly skewed toward femininity, and most white draconals are female or have protective or serene personalities. <i>White</i> represents brightness, fulfillment, metal, mourning, and purity. <i>White</i> draconals are immune to cold damage, and their breath weapon is cold. A white draconal adds Artifice, Liberation, and Repose to its list of possible domains. <i>Yellow</i>: Like black, yellow is a balance between male and female energy. <i>Yellow</i> represents earth, oracles, stone, and luck. <i>Yellow</i> draconals are immune to acid, and their breath weapon is acid. A yellow draconal adds Earth, Glory, and Luck to its list of possible domains.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Draconic, Infernal; speak with animals, truespeech", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or flight (3-6)", "Ref": "16", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(24d10+192)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 36, Dex 15, Con 27, Int 24, Wis 24, Cha 23", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1088, "SubType": "(agathion, extraplanar, good)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Combat Casting, Dodge, Empower Spell, Greater Spell Penetration, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Mobility, Power Attack, Quicken Spell, Skill Focus (Perception), Spell Penetration", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "22", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "36, touch 18, flat-footed 33", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Draconal", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +25, Bluff +29, Diplomacy +26, Escape Artist +22, Heal +27, Intimidate +29, Knowledge (arcana) +30, Knowledge (nature) +27, Knowledge (planes) +34, Knowledge (religion) +31, Perception +48, Sense Motive +34, Spellcraft +27, Stealth +21, Use Magic Device +26", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "17", "Race": "", "CR": "20", "XP": 307200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any air (Nirvana)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "celestial focus, divine insight, lay on hands (10d6, 16/day, as a 20th-level paladin)", "Saves": "Fort +22, Ref +16, Will +17; +4 vs. poison, +4 resistance vs. evil,", "Melee": "bite +36 (2d6+13 plus 1d6 energy), 2 claws +31 (1d8+6 plus 1d6 energy)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 120 ft.
