With its long, strong legs a sea spider can propel itself underwater as easily as it can glide upon the surface. Sea spiders make their lairs in shallow underwater caverns in secluded lagoons of uninhabited islands. They never leave the sea as they cannot long stand the stillness of dry land.</p><p>Sea spiders survive on a diet of plants, coral, and undersea denizens, preferring shark and eel to other aquatic life. A meal is devoured immediately, though not necessarily digested immediately. A sea spider has an extra stomach in which it stores food for later digestion. This allows the spider to go long periods of time between meals.</p><p>A sea spider is about 16 feet long and resembles a monstrous spider with fur of varying hues of blues and greens.</p><p>Sea spiders never venture on land, confining their attacks to ships. They usually attach themselves to the ship with the sticky hairs of their hind legs. This brings their mouth to the level of the deck where they may bite the ship, trying to disable it, or any person in close range. Their forelegs are free to swing at opponents. If no one is in range, the sea spider relocates to another area of the ship and attack again. Their primary tactic is to grapple opponents and draw them to the mouth, attempting to swallow them whole.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(15d10+60)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 16, Con 18, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2995, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Skill Focus (Stealth), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth when floating on the surface", "AC": "24, touch 11, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Sea Spider", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +15, Stealth +6 (+14 when floating on the surface), Swim +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +12, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +19 (2d6+5 plus 1d4 acid plus grab), 4 slams +18 (1d8+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 90 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Huge"}
