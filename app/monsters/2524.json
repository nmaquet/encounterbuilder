They dwell deep underground where they dine on the flesh of elves, dwarves, goblins, and just about anything else that crosses their path. These creatures are never encountered on the surface world, preferring to spend their lives underground.</p><p>Draconids are solitary creatures and never mix with others of their own kind (except for mating purposes). If a draconid moves into another's territory, a fight almost always ensues as soon as they discover one another. A typical draconid hunting ground covers an area of nearly 10 miles from its lair.</p><p>When not hunting, a draconid spends its time in its lair. A draconid's lair is something most disgusting and quite memorable to those that stumble across it. A tangled mess of shiny coins and gems mixed with corpses, bones, and rotted flesh.</p><p>A draconid usually waits in its web until prey passes underneath or nearby. It then shoots a web, releases its breath weapon and moves into melee. Once engaged, the draconid bites with one head and breathes fire with the other. One favorite tactic is to slow larger foes with its webs while it snatches up smaller targets in its jaws and crush them, bathing them in fire, and hurling them away if they prove too troublesome.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Undercommon", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(15d8+60 plus 15)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 14, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2524, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (poison), Ability Focus (web), Alertness, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Snatch, Toughness, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 10, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Draconid", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +20, Perception +23, Sense Motive +20", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "11", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +7, Will +11", "Melee": "2 bites +17 (2d6+7 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., climb 20 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Huge"}
