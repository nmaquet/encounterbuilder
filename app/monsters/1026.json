Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripples or other signs of its presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell cast on an area containing a burrowing lava child flings the creature back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex)</b> A lava child is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance and has the earth descriptor. </h5><h5><b>Magma Throwing (Su)</b> A lava child can cough up a ball of magma into its hand as a move action. It remains hot as long as the lava child holds it, but cools to the ambient temperature 1 round after it is released. A lava child can throw a magma ball as if it were a flask of alchemist's fire, or add its damage to one successful claw attack. It can use this ability a number of times per day equal to its Hit Dice. On any round in which the lava child remains partially immersed in molten stone and does not leave it, it may scoop up a handful as a move action and then throw it as if using this ability, but that action does not count toward its daily limit. </h5><h5><b>Metal Immunity (Su)</b> Lava children ignore the presence of metal and are able to pass through it as easily as air. They are immune to metal weapons, and their attacks ignore any AC bonus (including enhancement bonuses) from metal armor and shields. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Cold and Water (Ex)</b> Spells and effects with the water or cold subtype inflict +50% damage against lava children (though these vulnerabilities do not stack-effects that are both cold and water still deal only an additional +50% damage). Splashing a lava child with at least 1 gallon of water inflicts 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Immersion in water causes lava children to take 2d6 points of damage per round and affects them as a <i>slow</i> spell while they remain submerged.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Lava children are ill-tempered creatures created by shaitan genies.
