They resemble prehistoric humans but are more bestial and apelike.</p><p>Their fur is coated with an oily, fatty substance excreted through the pores, which protects them from cold. Taer can see clearly even in heavy snowstorms due to a second transparent eyelid that protects the eye from blowing winds and heavy snow. Taer never wear clothing, although they do sometimes wear necklaces and bracelets of tooth and horn.</p><p>Taer do not have a formal language as such; they communicate with one another through grunts, hooting, and yelling, as well as a body language similar to that of apes.</p><p>Taer attack with their fists and bite, but occasionally use stone spears in combat. They are fierce creatures and very territorial, attacking any living creature that wanders into the area. Taer use their knowledge of the land to their advantage during combat by creating avalanches, burrowing under snow and attacking from surprise, and using snow-covered pits to trap their prey. They prefer to drive intruders off rather than kill them.<b></p><p>Taer Society</b></p><p> Taers are nomadic creatures that band together in clans for protection, hunting, and social reasons. During the day, adults hunt for food, which consists of fruits, berries, nuts, insects, and game (goat, sheep, rodents, and the like). Though they do eat meat, taer do not hunt or eat humans or humanoids. Taer are extremely superstitious and fear metal and clothing and those that use and wear them. No taer ever wields or wears items of cloth or metal. Taer clans worship a snow-god to whom they offer sacrifices for protection and guidance. Each clan has a large stone idol of this snow god that is often located in the very heart of the clan or near the clan leader's cave.</p><p><br><b>Taer Characters</b><br> Taer characters possess the following racial traits.<br><b>+6 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, -4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma.</b><br><b>Cold Subtype:</b> This grants taer immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire.<br><b>Darkvision:</b> Taer can see in the dark out to a range of 60 ft.<br><b>Aura:</b> Stench (see above).<br><b>Racial Hit Dice:</b> A taer begins with three levels of monstrous humanoid, which provide 3d10 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +3, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +3, and Will +3.<br><b>Racial Skills:</b> A taer's monstrous humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 3 x (4 + Int modifier).<br><b>Racial Feats:</b> A taer's monstrous humanoid levels give it two feats.<br><b>AC:</b> +5 natural armor bonus.<br><b>Speed:</b> Taer have a base land speed of 50 ft.<br><b>Natural Weapons:</b> Taer can fight with 2 slam attacks that deal base 1d4 damage, as well as a bite attack that deals a base 1d4 damage.
