(These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) </h5><h5><b>Light Blindness (Ex)</b> Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a <i>daylight</i> spell) blinds a pech for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. </h5><h5><b>Stone Knowledge (Ex)</b> The extensive knowledge of stone that a pech possesses grants it a +1 racial bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures made of stone or earth (such as earth elementals, stone golems, and so on).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A pech is a fey creature believed to have its origins on the Elemental Plane of Earth. On the Material Plane, pechs dwell deep underground in places rarely even seen by dwarves, drow, or other subterranean races.</p><p>They are excellent stonemasons and are sometimes employed by other subterranean races for their skill at stoneworking (if such subterranean races can actually find the pech's lair). They are generally an isolated race and rarely venture far from their lairs. Pechs never wear armor and most are arrayed in nothing more than a simple loincloth of brown or black fur. Pechs speak Terran. Some pechs speak Common or Undercommon as well.</p><p>Pechs are generally noncombative, preferring to avoid such encounters if possible. If forced into combat, a pech relies on its pick and spell-like abilities to dispatch its opponents. Multiple pechs often work in concert with one another using their <i>wall of stone</i> ability to instantly erect a barrier that either traps their opponents or allows the pechs a means of escape.</p><p>Credit The Pech originally appeared in <i>S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</i> (\u00a9 TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Terran, Undercommon", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-4), pack (5-20), or tribe (21-40 plus 50% noncombatants)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d6+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 13, Con 13, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2926, "SubType": "(earth, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Craft (stonemasonry), +4 Profession (miner)", "AC": "17, touch 12, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Pech", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +1, Craft (stonemasonry) +12, Knowledge (nature) +8, Perception +11, Profession (miner) +10, Stealth +8, Survival +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Elemental Plane of Earth", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +5, Will +5", "Melee": "heavy pick +7 (1d4+4/x4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "NG", "Size": "Small"}
