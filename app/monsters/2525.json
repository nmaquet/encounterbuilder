When a cloud dragon uses its breath weapon, make a single bull rush attack using the dragon's CMB against the CMD of any creature that failed its Reflex save and is three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. This bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the dragon cannot choose to move with any opponent pushed back. In addition to being pushed back, affected creatures are knocked prone and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back. Flying creatures are buffeted and pushed back twice the distance and sustain 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back. </h5><h5><b>Cold Bite (Su)</b> At old age, a cloud dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of cold damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. </h5><h5><b>Cloud Form (Su)</b> As a standard action, a juvenile or older cloud dragon can assume <i>gaseous form</i> at will, but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. </h5><h5><b>Cloud Vision (Ex)</b> A very young cloud dragon can see perfectly in foggy conditions (such as those created by <i>fog cloud</i> or <i>obscuring</i> mist). </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Winds (Su)</b> A cloud dragon is immune to the effects of wind. It ignores the penalties applied to the Fly skill incurred by wind speed, and is immune to the negative effects of any spell or effect that manipulates wind, such as <i>gust of wind</i> and <i>whirlwind</i>. </h5><h5><b>Spell-like Abilities</b> A cloud dragon gains the following spelllike abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-<i>create water</i>; Juvenile-<i>obscuring</i> mist; Adult-<i>stinking cloud</i>; Old-<i>call lightning</i>; Ancient-<i>control winds</i>; Great Wyrm-<i>control weather</i>. </h5><h5><b>Whirlwind (Sp)</b> A great wyrm cloud dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a <i>whirlwind</i> spell. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Cloud dragons are the most reclusive of all dragons, rarely leaving the safety and sanctity of their cloudy lairs. They have a great dislike for non-flying creatures and creatures that must use non-natural means to fly (such as through magical items or spells). A cloud dragon wyrmling's scales are silvery-blue with a slight hint of red at the tip of each scale. As the dragon ages, its color slowly changes to a bright sunset orange. The oldest cloud dragons resemble gold dragons, save for the large bony plates on their heads and backs.</p><p>Cloud dragons are not highly aggressive, but dislike interlopers and attack them on sight. They open combat using their breath weapon, followed by their spell-like abilities. A cloud dragon rarely lands, preferring to fight from the air.</p><p>Credit The Cloud Dragon originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran, Aquan, Common, Draconic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or clan (2-5)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d12+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 14, Con 17, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "5 ft.
