This effect overloads the opponent's brain dazing it for 1d6+2 rounds and confusing it for 1 hour (treat as a <i>confusion</i> spell, caster level equals the memory child's Hit Dice). A successful DC 16 Will save negates the stunning effect and reduces the <i>confusion</i> effect to 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based. This ability is always active but can be suppressed or restarted by the memory child as a free action. </h5><h5><b>Thought Consumption (Su)</b> A memory child can drain an opponent's thoughts and memories by touch. (The opponent retains its memories; the memory child just copies them). By making a successful melee touch attack, a memory child deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage to its opponent. A memory child must consume at least 4 points of Intelligence each day or it suffers the effects of starvation.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A memory child is an extraplanar being from an unknown plane of existence whose sole purpose is the harvesting and collecting of memories from all of those it encounters. Such memories function as food for the memory child (though it retains all memories collected; that is, they are not actually devoured and do not disappear). Memory children take delight in traveling to the Material Plane and so are most often encountered there, especially in places where intelligent creatures reside such as cities and towns.</p><p>A memory child waits until the perfect moment to use its abilities. It rarely if ever engages in melee, preferring to flee rather than engage a foe in combat. If possible, it uses its special abilities to make such combat unnecessary.</p><p>To the observer, a memory child looks exactly like an ordinary child (male or female) about 7 or 8 years old with delicate features, pale skin, and innocent eyes of blue (all memory children have blue eyes).</p><p>Regardless of its actual age, a memory child never seems to grow up or grow old.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Common; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+16 plus 8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 14, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2811, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Memory Child", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Diplomacy +4, Disguise +5, Knowledge (arcana) +12, Knowledge (history) +12, Knowledge (planes) +12, Perception +15, Perform (oratory) +11, Sense Motive +4, Stealth +15, Survival +3", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +6, Will +10", "Melee": "touch +9 (1d4 plus thought consumption)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
