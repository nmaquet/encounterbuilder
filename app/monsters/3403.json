With a successful grapple check it deals double its regular bite damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The tunnel worm is a burrowing creature related to the monstrous centipede. It is a very aggressive predator and hunter, though it can sustain itself by scavenging. Its preferred food is fresh, raw meat. Tunnel worms are very aggressive and attack anything that enters their territory.</p><p>Tunnel worms live in mazelike complexes of burrows connected by passages they have chewed out over time; these burrows are often filled with the rotting remains of past prey, used by the worm to incubate its offspring. The favored tactic of the tunnel worm is to lurk beneath the surface of the ground or behind a wall until it senses a creature moving by, whereupon it burrows out to surprise and attack its prey (treat this attack as a charge attack). A tunnel worm that has taken more than half its hit points in damage retreats to its lair unless it is cornered, in which case it fights to the death.</p><p>A typical tunnel worm is 30 feet long, but can grow to a length of 60 feet.</p><p>Credit The Tunnel Worm originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or cluster (2-5)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+54 plus 9)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 13, Con 22, Int 1, Wis 10, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3403, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Toughness, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 9, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Tunnel Worm", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +9, Will +5", "Melee": "bite +14 (2d6+9 plus grab)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., burrow 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
