Some unknown botanist-perhaps one of the N'gathau themselves-supposedly spliced an unknown root from that dismal place with the assassin vine to create this monstrosity. Several other theories as to this plant's origin abound, but this one is the most widely accepted. The root system of the bloodsoaker vine needs blood to survive in the same manner as other plants need water. The vine provides nourishment for itself and the host tree from which it dangles by shredding unfortunate forest travelers into easily degraded bits. The trees benefit from the meaty compost while the bloodsoaker vine-true to the name-hungrily feeds on the blood of its victim and any that saturates the nearby soil. A typical bloodsoaker vine is a mass of roots, vines, and tendrils. Coloration ranges from deep greens to various browns, and all colors in between. The bloodsoaker vine eventually changes colors to better match its surroundings the longer it remains in one location. Ironically, the bloodsoaker vine produces an orchid-like flower thought by many to be among the most beautiful in creation. Far above the carnage below, where its tendrils break the forest canopy, delicate pink blossoms spread their petals and nourish birds and insects with sweet-smelling nectar.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or colony (2-5)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(11d8+55 plus 11)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4749, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Iron Will, Power Attack, Toughness, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (tendril)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 9, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Bloodsoaker Vine", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +14, Perception +9, Stealth +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests or marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +3, Will +6", "Melee": "6 tendrils +14 (1d8+6 plus bleed)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., climb 10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
