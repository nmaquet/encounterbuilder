Anyone who dies from tumor infestation turns into a hungry flesh 1d4 hours later. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Monstrous Growth (Ex)</b> A hungry flesh gains growth points from its reactive regeneration ability or from eating creatures. When it consumes a creature that's been dead no more than an hour, it gains 1 growth point if that creature is of its size or one size category smaller, or 2 growth points if its meal is larger than it is. Eating a creature takes a full-round action if it is the same size or smaller than the hungry flesh or 1 minute if it is larger. Each time a hungry flesh reaches 5 growth points, it gains the giant creature simple template. This template stacks with itself each time the hungry flesh gains another 5 growth points, but the hungry flesh can't increase its size beyond Gargantuan. When it stops gaining growth points, a hungry flesh loses a single application of the giant creature simple template for each hour that passes. </h5><h5><b>Reactive Regeneration (Ex)</b> Whenever a hungry flesh takes piercing or slashing damage, it regenerates 5 hit points and gains 1 growth point. </h5><h5><b>Slime Trail (Ex)</b> A hungry flesh leaves behind a trail of slime that acts as a <i>grease</i> spell (DC 17). Any living creature that touches this slime with bare flesh must succeed at a Fortitude save (with a +4 bonus) or contract tumor infestation. The slime dries up after 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Created in a laboratory by an alchemist researching methods of regenerating human flesh, a hungry flesh is a freakish creature made of aggressive, malignant tissue. It lives only to feed and grow, and must consume large amounts of plant and animal matter to sustain itself. Each day, a hungry flesh must consume its own weight in food. A hungry flesh resists attempts to cut or pierce it, quickly repairing the damage and creating new fleshy growths. With the right food and attacks to catalyze its growth, a hungry flesh can balloon to twice its normal size in minutes. A hungry flesh can grow to Gargantuan size. A hungry flesh starts out at approximately 7 feet in diameter, and weighs 3,000 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or cluster (2-5)", "Ref": "-2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+25)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 5, Con 20, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5263, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "8, touch 6, flat-footed 8", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Hungry Flesh", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-4", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "compression, monstrous growth, reactive regeneration, slime trail", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref -2, Will -4", "Melee": "slam +5 (1d6+4 plus disease and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
