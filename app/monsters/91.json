Executioners, not judges, erinyes alight upon the bladed eaves of Dis, Hell's cosmopolitan second layer, ever attentive for chances to soar into battle, whether in defense of Hell, on the whims of diabolical masters, or at the impassioned summons of jilted mortal summoners. All erinyes weave deadly living ropes from their own hair, which they use in battle to lift their foes into the air, mocking and condemning their victims for their transgressions before dropping them from great heights.</p><p>Erinyes appear as darkly beautiful angels, augmenting their sensuality with deliberate bruises and scars. Yet despite their beauty, erinyes are not seducers-they lack the subtlety and patience required for such fine emotional manipulations, and instead vastly prefer to solve their problems with swift and excruciating violence. Often, an erinyes will stay her hand before attempting to slay a foe simply so she can draw out the victim's suffering. Death is usually the only way to escape an erinyes's not-so-tender attentions, and the most powerful of these devils excel at keeping their enemies alive but helpless so as to extend their torment-many going as far as to keep their victims alive with magic. Rumors hold that the most powerful erinyes torturers have skills that allow their torment to continue even after their subject has died from their attentions.</p><p>Most erinyes stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh approximately 140 pounds, even with their blackfeathered wings that stretch over 10 feet wide.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or trio", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+45)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 23, Con 21, Int 14, Wis 18, Cha 21", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "+1 flaming composite longbow +14/+14/+9 (1d8+6/x3 plus 1d6 fire) or rope +15 touch (entangle)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 91, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, DodgeB, MobilityB, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Shot on the Run", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 17, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Erinyes Devil", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +18, Bluff +17, Diplomacy +14, Escape Artist +12, Fly +19, Intimidate +17, Knowledge (planes) +8, Knowledge (religion) +8, Perception +16, Sense Motive +10, Stealth +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Hell)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +12, Will +7", "Melee": "+1 longsword +15/+10 (1d8+8/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 50 ft.
