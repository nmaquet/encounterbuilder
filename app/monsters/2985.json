This painful howling affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazed for one round. The save DC is Charisma-based. The effects of multiple screaming devilkin using their scream ability in an overlapping area is not cumulative; only one save need be made each round. Conversation, even shouting, is inaudible within 60 feet of a screaming devilkin using this ability. Spellcasters in the area must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) each time they try to cast a spell. <i>Silence</i> negates the devilkin's scream for the duration of the spell.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Shrill wails echoing through the night signal the arrival of a screaming devilkin. Screaming devilkins are smallish beasts, humanoid in appearance but with frail and spindly arms and legs. These weak limbs are nearly useless for combat and locomotion, but the screaming devilkin makes up for this disability with its bat-like wings. Although screaming devilkins are fast fliers, they are not particularly agile on the wing. Screaming devilkins also have a long, muscular, barbed tail that is their primary means of physical attack. It should be noted that despite its appearance and name, the screaming devilkin has no connection with outsiders of any type.</p><p>A screaming devilkin is a tireless combatant, refusing to back down regardless of how the combat is progressing; it always attacks on sight.</p><p>It attacks in melee by stabbing with its barbed tail (inflicting piercing damage) and screams continuously until it or its opponent is dead.</p><p>A typical screaming devilkin is 3 feet tall and has a wingspan of about 5 feet. Its skin is reddish-brown in color and its eyes are black. Its tail is about 2-1/2 feet long.</p><p>Credit The Screaming Devilkin originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Philip Masters.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Infernal", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pack (2-5)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 17, Con 10, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2985, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 15, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Screaming Devilkin", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +5, Perception +4, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +6, Will +1", "Melee": "tail-barb +7 (1d4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., fly 30 ft.
