Such images cause the victim to see and hear things that are not really there or to see and hear things differently than they actually are. Things such as following footsteps, bumps and thumps from an unknown source, a gnarled tree with outstretched limbs scratching on a window or reaching for someone, the idea that someone or something is lurking around the corner, in the closet, or under the bed, and so on. A creature affected by the images takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if it fails a DC 19 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the bogeyman's Ability Focus feat. The bogeyman can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. A creature who drops to Wisdom 0 is affected as if by an <i>insanity</i> spell (caster level 8th) until at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored. </h5><h5><b>Frighten (Su)</b> A living creature within 60 feet that views a bogeyman must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or stand frozen in fear for 1d6+2 rounds. Such a creature is not helpless, but cannot take any action. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same bogeyman's frighten ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Shadow Shift (Su)</b> A bogeyman has the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a <i>dimension door</i> spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A bogeyman can shift up to a total of 80 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 80 feet or multiple jumps of 10 feet each. This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Bogeymen are the stuff of legends: creatures created in the minds of parents who relayed stories about incorporeal ghosts coming to carry their children off if they didn't go to bed when they were supposed to, didn't do their chores when asked, and so on. The apparitional bogeyman's ties to the land of the living are a result of these stories.</p><p>By their very nature, bogeymen are not evil. They derive more pleasure from tormenting and harassing an opponent rather than outright killing it. Generally if a bogeyman reduces a living creature to a comatose state (by draining its Wisdom) it leaves it where it falls. Bogeymen feed off the fear and madness induced in living creatures rather than their blood, life force, or flesh.</p><p>A bogeyman stands about 6 feet tall and appears as an incorporeal humanoid with a child-like countenance and delicate features. It robes and sash seem to constantly billow and blow as if by some unseen breeze.</p><p>A bogeyman rarely confronts a party of adventurers, preferring to attack a lone individual when it is most vulnerable. Bogeymen always attack at night; none have ever been encountered during daylight hours. A bogeyman that fancies a creature may stalk that being for days, torturing it with its bump in the night ability before finally driving the victim completely mad.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Goblin, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d8+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 17, Con -, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2275, "SubType": "(incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (bump in the night), Alertness, Improved Initiative, Weapon Focus (incorporeal touch)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 16, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Bogeyman", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +11, Diplomacy +11, Intimidate +14, Perception +15, Sense Motive +15, Stealth +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "shadow shift", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +8", "Melee": "incorporeal touch +10 (1d6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Medium"}
