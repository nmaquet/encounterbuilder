Intelligent, even-tempered, and deadly in combat, dragonkin get along well with humanoids. Unlike many other dragons, dragonkin have enough dexterity in their front limbs to have adopted weapons, favoring huge glaives and long lances. The most unique aspect of dragonkin is their bond with other races. Dragonkin opposed to the depredations of evil dragons in the Drakelands recognize other cultures' potential, and such individuals often adopt humanoid riders. After it comes of age, a dragonkin may form an unbreakable partnership with a rider, who acts as a trusted comrade. In battle, a rider and her dragon are inseparable, in such constant telepathic communication that they almost seem to be one entity. When not fighting, the humanoids are responsible for caring and providing for their draconic companions, though this domestic role is more a social dynamic than outright servitude. Built for speed, dragonkin are long and sleek. Many adopt mannerisms from humanoid races, even going so far as to wear armor, and this, combined with the fact that dragonkin have thrown in their lot with humanoids, sometimes disgusts true dragons. A typical dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and roughly 2,000 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic", "Source": "Distant Worlds", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, patrol (3-6), or wing (7-14)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d12+50)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 15, Con 20, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "10 ft.
