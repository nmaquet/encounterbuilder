This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 16 half). A flying creatures that fails its Reflex save is pushed 1d4 x 5 feet from the center of the fogburst's area of effect (taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet if it strikes a solid object), while creatures on the ground are knocked prone on a failed save. The area of effect of the fogburst is filled with mist (as <i>obscuring</i> mist) for 1d4 rounds after impact. Once a mist drake has used its fogburst attack, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Fogvision (Ex)</b> A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist, fog, or precipitation. </h5><h5><b>Misty Camouflage (Ex)</b> A mist drake can use Stealth to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an area of mist, even while being observed. </h5><h5><b>Speed Surge (Ex)</b> Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to take an additional move action in that round.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Mist drakes are less openly aggressive than most drakes, as they are not as physically strong and imposing as most of their kin. Their bodies are narrow and serpentine, more suited for quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics than for close combat. However, they excel at stealth for creatures of their size, and can expel a burst of thick fog whenever they need to create a diversion or screen themselves from archers trying to target them. In the mist, they move swiftly and silently to disperse groups of foes with their explosive breath and then single out one of their enemies for a quick and deadly attack before their victim's allies can regroup and come to its rescue. Mist drakes mate only once few decades, but are more caring parents than others of their ilk. After the clutch of two to six eggs hatch, the hatchlings stay with their mother for up to 20 years before seeking out their own hunting territory. Mist drakes live up to 200 years. A typical mist drake is 13 feet long from head to tail tip, but these lithe dragons rarely weigh more than 1,000 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or rampage (3-12)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d12+18)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5199, "SubType": "(air)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Flyby Attack, Hover", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in fog or mist", "AC": "19, touch 12, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mist Drake", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +9, Intimidate +9, Perception +10, Stealth +7 (+15 in fog or mist), Survival +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold or temperate coasts, hills, or marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "misty camouflage, speed surge", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +7, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +9 (2d6+4), tail slap +4 (1d8+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 80 ft.
