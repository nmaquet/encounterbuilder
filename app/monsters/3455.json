Living creatures within the area not only take damage but also are stunned for one round. A successful DC 20 Reflex save reduces the electricity damage by half and negates the stunning effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Giant electric catfish make their homes beneath fallen logs and in streambed pits where they face upstream with their mouth open, swallowing everything resembling food that should tumble or float into its toothless maw. They favor dank, dark, slow moving or stagnant water with limited visibility. They are nocturnal hunters and venture out a few hours after sunset to hunt.</p><p>Giant electric catfish are about eight feet long but can grow to lengths of 12 feet or more. Its bloated body is generally gray or grayish-brown in color fading to a dull white or cream color on its underbelly. Its eyes are small and its snout wide and round. Three sets of barbels (or feelers) are located around its mouth. Unlike many fish, a giant electric catfish has no dorsal fin.</p><p>Giant electric catfish are territorial and defend their realms with great ferocity. Before engaging in combat, when threatened or facing a potential enemy, an electric catfish generates a pulse of crackling electricity in an effort to intimidate or discourage would-be predators. Failing this, the giant electric catfish enters combat and bites its foe. A giant electric catfish produces an electrical charge that tends to stun any creature within ten feet of it. Stunned prey are bitten and swallowed.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or school (5-8)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d8+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3455, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (electricity discharge), Iron Will, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 11, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Giant Electric Catfish", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +16, Swim +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +9, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +11 (1d8+6 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
