Creatures entering or within the area must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or become nauseated for as long as they remain in the area plus 1d4 rounds after. Creatures succeeding on their save are immune to the effects of the aura for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Disease (Ex)</b> <i>Stygian Sickness</i>: Bite; save DC 14 Fort; <i>onset</i> 1day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Intelligence and 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who dies while infected rises as a zombyre in 2d6 hours. The save is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Staggered (Ex)</b> Zombyres have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or standard action each round. A zombyre can move up to its speed and attack in the same round as a charge action. This flaw only affects zombyres when on land; while underwater, in combat, a zombyre loses this flaw. </h5><h5><b>Stygian Healing (Su)</b> A zombyre regains 1 hit point each hour when fully submerged in the River Styx. This healing cannot restore more hit points than the maximum the zombyre possesses and it does not restore any lost limbs.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A zombyre is a living creature that drowned in the River Styx, reanimated by the magic of the Stygian waters for some unknown purpose. It is a free-willed, semi-intelligent creature appearing much as a normal zombie, though bloated from its time spent underwater. Zombyres tend to dwell in packs, loosely organized but seemingly bound together by some unknown force. Some sages speculate this happens when a group of individuals all drown together, such as a group of sailors who perish when their ship sinks. Zombyres tend to stay within the area where they drowned; sometimes making their lair in the very ship that sank beneath the waves and cost them their life. They do not appear to be bound to the area as some undead are to the place where they died. Zombyres are most active at night, rarely venturing onto land during the day. Even nighttime excursions rarely see a zombyre travel more than several hundred feet from the water's edge. Creatures that venture too close to a zombyre pack are attacked and dragged into the water, where the zombyre pack feasts and dines on the remnants of those so foolhardy. In battle, groups of zombyres are relentless combatants and generally swarm their opponents, attacking with their powerful fists and diseased bite. Large packs of zombyres have been known to climb aboard anchored ships, pull the seamen overboard, and attack them in the Stygian waters where the zombyres are faster and more at home. Such sailors pulled overboard are often times held under the water and drowned.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (3-8)", "Ref": "0", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+10 plus 5)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 8, Con -, Int 4, Wis 12, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5106, "SubType": "(aquatic, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will, Power Attack, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 9, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Zombyre", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Perception +4, Swim +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (River Styx)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "staggered, Stygian healing Languages Common (can't speak)", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +0, Will +7", "Melee": "slam +6 (1d8+3 plus grab), bite +6 (1d6+3 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
