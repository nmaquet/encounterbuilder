They seek out hosts through which to propagate their contagion. Though they are considered swarms, their individual components are so small as to be invisible to unaided sight, exponentially smaller than even Fine creatures, and they are thus considered one Medium creature. They are only visible at all due to the sheer number of individual organisms that comprise the swarm; literally billions of them make up a single living disease. Living diseases offer no resistance to items or creatures entering their midst and cannot be physically felt. They make no sound whatsoever. A living disease in the dark is terrible indeed, as there is no indication it is present until its effects are first felt. Living diseases neither see nor sleep. Their movements are by pure instinct, and they locate potential hosts with their lifesense. Because of their resilience and extremely high reproductive rate, the microorganisms of a living disease give it fast healing 10. Though extremely rare, there are many different kinds of living diseases - potentially as many kinds as there are diseases. Two in particular are described here: festering lung and black rot. A living disease seeks to surround any potential host it senses. It instinctively avoids undead, oozes, plants and constructs, which do not make suitable hosts for the spreading of disease. Unlike normal swarms, a living disease does not deal physical damage. Instead it exposes any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move to its form of disease.
