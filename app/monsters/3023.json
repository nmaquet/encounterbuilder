It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The slithering tracker merely has to move into a space occupied by a paralyzed creature, completely covering it. An engulfed opponent is subjected to the slithering tracker's paralysis and plasma drain, and is considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. A slithering tracker only uses this ability against a paralyzed, sleeping, or otherwise helpless opponent. </h5><h5><b>Plasma Drain (Ex)</b> A slithering tracker drains the body fluids from an engulfed opponent. Each 5 minutes an opponent is engulfed, it takes 1 point of Constitution damage. Because it takes a long time to completely drain a foe, a slithering tracker generally only uses this ability against a paralyzed, stunned, held, or sleeping opponent. </h5><h5><b>Sealed Mind (Ex)</b> Even though a slithering tracker has an Intelligence score, it is immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) just as other oozes are. </h5><h5><b>Transparent (Ex)</b> A slithering tracker is hard to identify, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Perception check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a slithering tracker and walk into it are automatically hit with a slam attack and subjected to the creature's paralysis attack.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The slithering tracker is an amorphous and transparent creature that inhabits dark underground areas of the world. Unlike other oozes, the slithering tracker does not feed on organic matter. It survives by devouring living creatures.</p><p>A typical slithering tracker is 3 feet long and has a thickness of about 6 inches. It can grow to a length of about 8 feet.</p><p>A slithering tracker prefers to attack helpless or immobile opponents.</p><p>Once it paralyzes an opponent, the slithering tracker flows over it and drains its body fluids. The tracker, now sated, slithers off to digest its meal. All that's left of the opponent is a dry and rotted husk.</p><p>Credit The Slithering Tracker originally appeared in the <i>Strategic Review #5</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1975) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(5d8+25)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3023, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception), Skill Focus (Stealth)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Slithering Tracker", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +10, Perception +8, Stealth +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +1, Will +1", "Melee": "slam +6 (1d4+3 plus paralysis)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., climb 10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
