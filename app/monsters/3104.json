Immunity to poison negates this effect. </h5><h5><b>Liquefy Organs (Ex)</b> A tentamort can insert the needlelike projection from its stinging tentacle into the body of a foe grappled by either tentacle. Doing so requires a successful melee attack, and the tentamort cannot insert the projection into a creature grappled with its constricting tentacle if its stinging tentacle is also grappling a foe. Once inserted, the tentamort injects a digestive liquid and a paralytic poison (see above) through the hollow barb that liquefies the victim's internal organs; the tentamort draws this liquefied slurry back through the hollow needle into its own body to feed. This attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the tube remains inserted in a foe. Once the needle is removed or the tentamort is killed, the foe continues to take 1 point of Constitution damage until it succeeds at a DC 13 Fortitude save. This Constitution damage can be halted by spells or effects that remove disease or heal ability score damage (including <i>lesser</i> restoration).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Tentamorts are thought to have arrived on the Material Plane through a tear in the planar fabric. They are rarely encountered above ground, preferring the darkness of underground caverns and dungeons. The tentamort somewhat resembles a squid. Its body is a small, 3-foot diameter sphere of gray, hard flesh. Two 10-foot long tentacles protrude from the upper half of its body while eight 2-foot long tentacles hang from its underside (it uses these for movement only). Of the two large tentacles, one is thicker and covered with squid-like suction cups, while the other is leaner, and is tipped with a bone-colored needle-sharp barb.</p><p>A tentamort uses its small tentacles to crawl along ceilings and walls.</p><p>When prey passes underneath, it drops on its opponent, grabbing it with its tentacles and injecting it with its deadly acid. If two targets are available within reach, it will direct a separate tentacle at each one, hoping to hold one target in place long enough to paralyze the other, then detach its stinging tentacle and focus both attacks on the remaining prey.</p><p>Credit The Tentamort originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Mike Roberts.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or brood (2-5)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(4d8+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 12, Con 12, Int 1, Wis 10, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.
