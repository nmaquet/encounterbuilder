Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell for 2d6 minutes. Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be a treant or other such friendly tree creature). An affected creature becomes passive and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. An affected creature can attempt a new Will save (DC 19, +1 per previous save) each round. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected by the hallucinatory spores of that hangman's tree for 24 hours. </h5><h5><b>Paralyzed by Cold (Ex)</b> Cold-based effects paralyze a hangman tree as if by a <i>hold person</i> spell. </h5><h5><b>Slowed by Darkness (Ex)</b> Spells that generate <i>darkness</i> (such as <i>darkness</i> or <i>deeper</i> <i>darkness</i>) <i>slow</i> the hangman's tree (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 1 round per caster level. </h5><h5><b>Vines (Ex)</b> The vines of a hangman tree have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a hangman tree's vine does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the vine is currently grappling a target, the hangman tree takes a -4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a vine deals no damage to a hangman tree.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Close inspection reveals a scar-like marking on the lower part of the trunk of this tree; this is where undigested creatures or gear is expelled after digestion.
