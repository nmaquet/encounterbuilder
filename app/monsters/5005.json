The scream lasts until the beginning of its next turn. All creatures within 40 feet of the deadly mandrake when it begins its scream, as well as those that end their turn within the area, must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save. (This save is only required once per scream.) Creatures under the effects of a fear effect take a -2 penalty on this save. Creatures that make their save are sickened for 1d2 rounds. Those that fail their save take 20 points of damage. If a screaming mandrake is damaged during a scream, it must make a Will save (DC 15 + damage taken) to maintain the scream; otherwise it ends. This is a sonic death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Deadly mandrakes are mischievous plant creatures believed to be part plant and part fey. They relish in playing tricks on those passing through their domain. These tricks are always more playful than harmful, at least to the deadly mandrake. Most such tricks take the form of lights or weird sounds meant to distract and confuse travelers. Deadly mandrakes sustain themselves on a diet of tree bark, leaves, and berries, and are most active during the day. At night they burrow into the ground to rest. Often times, a deadly mandrake burrows just far enough into the ground to cover its body, leaving the flower on top of its head exposed. Little else is known of these creatures thus far. Deadly mandrakes, despite their name, are generally inoffensive unless disturbed. If disturbed or forced into battle, deadly mandrakes use their death scream immediately in an attempt to end the confrontation as quickly as possible. Creatures that resist are subjected to <i>sleep</i>, <i>lesser confusion</i>, or <i>hypnotism</i>. They can attack with their claws if needed, but rarely do so. Any deadly mandrake killed has a 1% chance of returning in 1d4 days as a mandragora. If the deadly mandrake's body is doused with demon ichor (from a demon CR 6 or above), or a deadly mandrake is killed by a demon CR 6 or above, the chance rises to 10%. Using a deadly mandrake in the alchemical creation of a mandragora lowers the Craft (alchemy) DC from 25 to 20. (See the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 2 \"Mandragora\", for details on the mandragora and the creation of a mandragora.)</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or grove (2-6)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d8+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 6, Dex 18, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5005, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 in vegetation", "AC": "17, touch 16, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Deadly Mandrake", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +5, Escape Artist +5, Knowledge (nature) +1, Perception +7, Perform (sing) +4, Sense Motive +3, Stealth +16 (+24 in vegetation)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +5, Will +2", "Melee": "2 claws +8 (1d2-2)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., burrow 10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Tiny"}
