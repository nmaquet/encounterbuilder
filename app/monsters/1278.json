Ridged, rust-colored skin covers their chests and stomachs, and a mottled wash of green, brown, and orange colors their fins like aging kelp. Locathahs exude a strong fishy odor when above water that, in addition to their already unnerving appearance, repulses most landdwellers.</p><p>Despite this animosity, locathahs go to great lengths to befriend surface folk, offering safe passage through the waters, pointing out dangerous reefs, and hinting at sunken treasures in return for durable ceramics and metal tools and weapons, as well as tubers, which they view as a delicacy.</p><p>These creatures dislike combat and flee when disarmed or outnumbered. Locathahs hold community in the highest regard, never leaving a friend behind and often going to great lengths to retrieve a fallen companion. Among their own kind and races friendly toward them, locathahs are social creatures who live a very human-like, albeit simple, lifestyle. Locathahs work in stone, coral, and bone to produce the crude implements they use. Some take coral work to obsessive levels, with certain clans taking generations to grow their preferred medium in its desired form before carving it. They feed on crustaceans, undersea plants, and shellfish, and rarely on large fish that are caught during ritualized hunts.</p><p>Locathah matriarchs serve their undersea tribes not only as chieftains, but also as the primary egg layers of the community. Each adult member of the tribe is responsible for raising a single young locathah as his or her own.</p><p>Locathahs tame moray eels, keeping them near their lairs as humans keep dogs. Some locathah soldiers and hunting groups use giant moray eels as mounts, chasing down their quarry and attacking with narrow-tipped spears. More powerful aquatic races use locathahs as slaves, abducting breeding matriarchs to produce a constant wave of new workers.</p><p>Locathah stand roughly as tall as humans, yet their fins jut out, giving them an imposing stature. Lean and strong, locathahs weigh roughly 160 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, band (2-10), or tribe (11-30 plus 2 fighter sergeants of 1st-3rd level and 1 cleric leader of 3rd-6th level)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 12, Con 10, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "light crossbow +2 (1d8/19-20)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1278, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Focus (longspear)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "13, touch 11, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Locathah", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Craft (any one) +6, Perception +3, Survival +6, Swim +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "1/2", "XP": 200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate or warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +1, Will +1", "Melee": "longspear +2 (1d8/x3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
