The save DC is Strength-based. An engulfed creature can be freed by killing the livestone or by casting <i>stone to flesh</i> on the livestone. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the livestone and automatically ejects an engulfed victim. </h5><h5><b>Solidify (Ex)</b> A livestone can solidify all or part of itself into a material with the hardness and consistency of solid rock. A solidified part of a livestone has a hardness of 8 and a break DC of 50. A livestone can effect the solidification as a free action. An opponent attacking a livestone must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save each time his attack hits. If the save is failed, the livestone actually solidifies the portion of its body at the instant it was hit, thus applying its hardness rating of 8 to any damage it takes. A livestone cannot attack if its entire form is solidified. The save DC is Strength-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Livestone is a strange species of ooze that can solidify itself into a consistency that very closely resembles that of stone. In its solidified form, a livestone is indistinguishable from a normal boulder or slab of rock. No one is quite sure from where livestones originated, but ancient legends say that the dwarves accidentally unleashed these horrors on the surface world by digging into their subterranean lairs. Eventually, some livestones found their way to the surface. Livestones are incredibly longlived, solidifying and entering a form of hibernation and remaining that way indefinitely until a food source wanders too near. Livestones have a simple chameleon-like ability to mimic local stone by ingesting a small sample and adjusting its own color and texture to match. A hibernating livestone can become covered in moss and lichens to further the deception.</p><p>Livestones generally attack from ambush, waiting for a potential meal to pass before flowing into their ooze form and rushing up to engulf the prey. If the surprise attack fails, a livestone resorts to hammering with a pseudopod. When attacking in this manner, a livestone will solidify the tip of the pseudopod and strike with a hammer-like blow. A livestone's usual tactic is to solidify the half of its body facing the prey and then send hard-tipped pseudopods out from behind this shield (see solidify above).</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or group (2-5)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d8+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 10, Con 20, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2782, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+12 Stealth in stony areas, +20 if it solidifies while in stony areas", "AC": "9, touch 9, flat-footed 9", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Livestone", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Stealth -4 (+8 in stony areas, +16 while solidified)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-3", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +2, Will -3", "Melee": "slam +10 (1d8+7)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
