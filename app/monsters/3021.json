By this time, their legs have fully developed and their tentacles have become pseudopodlike lashes. They have lost their slime coating but have replaced it with a paralytic venom exuded from the tips of their tentacles. They are even more voracious than in their larval form and activity hunt for ready sources of carrion at the outskirts of settlements, upon old battlefields, or even sewer tunnels beneath large population centers. They become viciously territorial in this stage of their development and, while they may allow other slime crawlers in their midst, other types of creatures had best beware, as they are perfectly happy to feed upon fresher faire.</p><p>A typical mature slime crawler is about 12 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.</p><p>A mature slime crawler attacks with its tentacles, trying to paralyze as many opponents as possible but if particularly hungry may stop in the midst of battle to feed on anyone it has disabled.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Casey Christofferson, Scott Greene, and Greg A.
