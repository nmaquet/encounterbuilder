When an opponent is dragged within 5 feet, the hanged man can attack with both of its claws in the same round. It gains a +4 attack bonus against opponents entangled in its rope. </h5><h5><b>Entangle (Su)</b> The hanged man's noose is a 20-ft. length of rope that entangles opponents of any size as an <i>animate rope</i> spell (CL 15th, DC 21). A hanged man can lash its rope outward 20 feet with no range penalty. The rope functions only for the hanged man it belongs to and no other. It has AC 22, hardness 10, hp 10, and DR 5/slashing. If the rope is severed, both it and the hanged man are destroyed. The save DC is Strength-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>A hanged man is the restless corpse of an evil humanoid that was hanged or the spirit of one wrongfully accused of a crime and hanged. It is a malevolent and vengeful creature that attacks living creatures on sight.</p><p>Hanged men are usually encountered near the area where they were killed or in cemeteries, mausoleums, or graveyards where their body was laid to rest. They prey on the living and are found near civilized areas where their food supply is plentiful. Its lair is either its final resting place or a secluded and overgrown area near the place of its death. Its lair is always scattered with the remains of its victims, including any treasure a former meal happened to be carrying.</p><p>A hanged man attacks primarily with its rope, which has become imbued with negative energy and now acts as an extension of the hanged man itself. It uses its rope to capture victims and draw them in where it rips and tears them to shreds with its filthy claws.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 13, Con -, Int 9, Wis 11, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rope touch +5 (entangle)", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2677, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Weapon Focus (rope)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Hanged Man", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +9 (+19 with rope), Perception +7, Stealth +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +4", "Melee": "2 claws +5 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
