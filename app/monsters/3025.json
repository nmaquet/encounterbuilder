The typical sloth viper is 9-10 feet long, <i>though they can grow to a length of 20 or more feet</i>. They subsist on a diet of small animals, preferring birds, lizards, and small mammals to others. They are fearless however, and do not hesitate to attack much larger prey such as cheetahs, leopards, and even lions. Once the sloth viper has fed, it often recoils high above the ground, under the thicket and blanket of leaves, branches, and limbs where it sleeps for the next 1d6 days.</p><p>The sloth viper is a solitary predator; rarely is more than one encountered.</p><p>If such an encounter takes place, they are often a mated pair, with a nest of eggs nearby. A sloth viper's lair is a dense thicket of natural underbrush and trees. A typical nest contains 1d4 emerald colored eggs.</p><p>Sloth vipers are hunted by some humanoids for their scales and poison (which is rumored to be valued by spellcasters for its properties).</p><p>Sloth vipers are ambush hunters and wait patiently among the limbs and branches of trees for potential prey to pass underneath it. When unsuspecting prey is in range, the viper either drops on it from above, or snaps down quickly with its vicious bite, recoiling back into the trees afterwards.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(5d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 19, Con 11, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3025, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics, +4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Sloth Viper", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +16, Climb +13, Perception +9, Stealth +8, Swim +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm forests and marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +8, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +8 (1d4+1 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft., swim 30", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
