Any creature slain by the dark custodian's energy drain is left a steaming, bloody skeleton, all of its soft tissues having been consumed by the undead. </h5><h5><b>Incorporeal Grab (Su)</b> If a dark custodian hits with an incorporeal touch, it can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. During the course of this grapple, the dark custodian becomes partially corporeal and its opponent becomes partially incorporeal. This has no game effect other than allowing the dark custodian to use its Strength bonus in its CMB. If it wins the grapple, it establishes a hold at which point its opponent becomes completely incorporeal, as well, along with the dark custodian. The dark custodian automatically begins to devour the held opponent each round he is held. The opponent remains incorporeal until he manages to break the grapple at which time he becomes immediately corporeal. If this occurs within a solid object, the opponent is forcefully ejected from the object's nearest surface, and the opponent takes 1d6 points of damage in the process. The dark custodian must then try to hit with its incorporeal touch attack again to try to reestablish the grapple. Once the dark custodian has an opponent pinned, it attempts to drag him away to devour him in peace. </h5><h5><b>Lifesense (Su)</b> A dark custodian notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast <i>deathwatch</i>. Walls less than 5 feet thick are no impediment to this ability. </h5><h5><b>Silence of the Grave (Su)</b> As a standard action a dark custodian can use its <i>silence</i> of the grave ability. This creates a <i>silence</i> effect as the spell in a 20-foot radius for 7 rounds. This silent zone acts as a <i>desecrate</i> spell giving the dark custodian a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws, as well as, imposing a -3 profane penalty on turn checks. Any living creature within the area of affect must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become <i>daze</i>d for 1 round. A new save is allowed each round. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. Because it takes place in an area of <i>silence</i>, it cannot be counteracted by bardic music. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the <i>daze</i> effect of the same dark custodian's <i>silence</i> of the grave for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)</b> Dark custodians are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a <i>daylight</i> spell) and flee from it. A dark custodian caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a single move action or attack action in a round. </h5><h5><b>Unnatural Aura (Su)</b> Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a dark custodian at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Dark custodians are the undead remains of evil clerics tasked to remain behind after death and guard the sacred places of their vile worship. They hate all living things and seek to devour any who come within their guarded precincts. They do not require these feedings for sustenance but rather merely take pleasure in the carnage and brutality. A dark custodian's true form is hidden beneath its ghostly burnoose with a lightless black void where its face should be. Only in combat are its hands seen, appearing pale with thickened, clawlike nails. They understand the languages they knew in life, but cannot speak. A dark custodian prefers to attack from ambush, leaping through a solid wall to make an incorporeal grab before dragging its prey back through with it. When attacking in groups they usually surround their prey and use their <i>silence</i> of the grave abilities before trying to grab and drag individual opponents in different directions to be consumed.
