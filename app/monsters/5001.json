On each such successful attack, the lurker wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Create Spawn (Su)</b> A humanoid slain by either a lurker wraith's Constitution drain or smother attack becomes a ghoul in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are not under the command of the lurker wraith (which typically ignores them), but they do instinctively protect their creator. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast, not a ghoul. </h5><h5><b>Smother (Ex)</b> When a lurker wraith grapples a target, it continues its Constitution drain each round (though the victim is still allowed a save each round). In addition it forms an airtight seal around its prey. A grappled target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see \"Suffocation\" in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game). </h5><h5><b>Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)</b> A lurker wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>If there is an undead form of the aberrations known as lurkers, this is surely it. They have a gauzy appearance and resemble some thin cloth, though close inspection reveals they are quite durable and thick with a certain translucence. They often disguise themselves as tapestries or curtains in order to lure the unwary into their smothering embrace. Sometimes they roll themselves up to appear as innocuous bolts of cloth before unfurling and revealing the true horror. They tend to lurk in subterranean areas or within ruins where they avoid rays of direct sunlight. A lurker wraith is about 10 feet long by 10 feet wide and approximately 1/4 inch thick. They weigh less than 50 pounds. Lurker wraiths typically disguise themselves as ordinary textiles and then try to attack prey with surprise by buffeting them and attempting to smother. There are often a few stray ghouls lairing near where lurker wraiths dwell - past victims that will come to defend their creator. Credit Original author Greg A.
