This penalty remains until the affected creature takes any amount of magical healing or is healed with a successful DC 20 Heal check. The save DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Hallucinatory Aura (Su)</b> Any creature coming within 20 feet of a yaenit must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or succumb to the demon's foul, mind-warping magic. A creature affected by a yaenit's hallucinatory aura takes a -2 penalty on Will saves, caster level checks, Intelligence-based skill checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks for as long as it remains within the aura's range and 1d4-1 rounds after leaving the area of effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save was successful, an affected creature is immune to the same yaenit's hallucinatory aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Violent progenitors of Lamashtu's earthly broods, the yaenit demons' purpose is to protect Lamashtu's priestesses and their unholy spawn. Yaenits rise from the souls of evil mortals who in life were exceptionally cruel bullies and tormentors of weaker companions, associates, minions, and siblings. Their resemblance to gnolls is no mere coincidence, as many yaenits take form from the spirits of gnolls in the Abyss. Gnolls, for their part, revere yaenits as embodiments of Lamashtu's foul will, and worship these demons as representatives of both the Mother of Monsters and her unholy designs for the devoted gnoll followers who please her. Terrifying predators, yaenits' deceptively stooped and gangly physiques belie the 300 pounds of knotted and powerful muscle tied to their solid, black bones. The average yaenit is 6-1/2 feet tall.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic, Gnoll; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Broken Chains", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pack (2-5), or clan (6-12)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 14, Con 19, Int 9, Wis 13, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4338, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Critical Focus, Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Acrobatics when jumping", "AC": "18, touch 12, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Yaenit", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +11 (+15 when jumping), Bluff +12, Climb +14, Intimidate +10, Knowledge (planes) +8, Perception +10, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (the Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +8, Will +5", "Melee": "mwk falchion +14/+9 (2d4+7/18-20), bite +8 (1d6+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
