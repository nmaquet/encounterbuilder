Each effect functions as the spell of the same name (caster level 12th). The save DCs are Charisma-based. <i>Fear</i>: All evil creatures within 80 feet must make a successful Will save or be affected as by a <i>fear</i> spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting <i>fear</i> effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by the <i>fear</i> effect of that moon dog's bay for 24 hours. <i>Dispel Evil</i>: This effect works like the spell, and affects one evil extraplanar creature within 80 feet. <i>Dismissal</i>: This effect works as the spell, except that it targets one evil extraplanar creature. </h5><h5><b>Keen Senses (Ex)</b> Moon dogs can see twice as far as humans in low-<i>light</i> and normal <i>light</i> conditions. </h5><h5><b>Lick (Su)</b> By licking a target, a moon dog may use one of the following abilities: cure <i>light</i> wounds, <i>delay poison</i>, <i>remove disease</i>. Each is usable at will by the moon dog, but only once per day per recipient. Each is caster level 12th. </h5><h5><b>Plane Shift (Su)</b> A moon dog can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, or Material Plane. This ability resembles the spell of the same name (caster level 12th). </h5><h5><b>Shadow Weave (Su)</b> When in shadows, a moon dog can move in such a way as to affect evil creatures within 60 feet as though by <i>hypnotic pattern</i> (DC 16 Will save, caster level 12th). Any good-aligned creature in the area of the shadow weave will be affected as though by <i>protection from evil</i> (caster level 12th). The shadow weave is a full-round action, and the moon dog must concentrate to maintain it.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The moon dog is a large wolfhound from the outer planes (believed to have its origins on the plane of Elysium). Moon dogs often enter the Material Plane when evil has grown to an immeasurable level in an area.</p><p>Otherwise, they are found in the employ of deities, solars, planetars, and the most powerful devas. Moondogs forepaws are prehensile and resemble human hands. Though moon dogs can move on two legs in a bipedal fashion, most do not do so, preferring the speed and grace they gain by moving on all fours.</p><p>A moon dog attacks with its powerful bite. If faced by particularly powerful or evil opponents, the moon dog opens combat with its bay attack. Moon dogs' prehensile hands could facilitate the use of weapons, though none have ever been encountered wielding such items.</p><p>A moon dog's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Credit The Moon Dog originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "telepathy 100 ft.
