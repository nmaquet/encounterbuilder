If it's not wielding a weapon, a gaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks. In addition, it takes up to eight gaavs cooperatively to lift a creature that one or more of them is grappling; each gaav can lift up to 50 pounds and still fly without being impeded. </h5><h5><b>Noxious Breath (Su)</b> Three times per day, a gaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same gaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. Once a gaav uses its breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. </h5><h5><b>Shared Senses (Su)</b> All gaavs and magaavs within 100 feet of one another share the same senses. Thus, if one individual perceives something (for example, with a successful Perception check), all others within range are immediately aware of it. Senses are instantly relayed from one gaav or magaav to the next, allowing for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread through and inform an entire massive swarm instantly. It is still possible for a gaav to be surprised or flat-footed even if other gaavs nearby are not. </h5><h5><b>Summon Devil (Su)</b> Once per day a gaav can attempt to summon an imp with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.</h5><h5><b> Swarming (Ex)</b> Up to two gaavs can share the same space at the same time. If two gaavs in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Hunters of souls, host devils retrieve Hell's most elusive property. Whether souls that have long evaded capture upon the plains of Avernus, damned beings who have somehow managed to escape Hell, or creatures that have reneged upon infernal contracts, vast flocks of these winged fiends swarm from the Pit to recover their prey. Rarely seen alone, host devils travel in great swarms that often number in the thousands. Amid these great hosts flap the swarm leaders, the magaav, fierce mockeries of the angelic form capable of directing and redirecting massive columns of their brethren like the brain of a single colossal infernal beast.</p><p>Gaavs stand 4 feet tall and weigh approximately 110 pounds, their wingspans stretching to just over 6 feet wide. Magaavs stand 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds, with wingspans reaching 10 feet across.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Book of the Damned V1", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or flock (2d4)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 7, Wis 9, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 412, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Hover", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 15, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lesser Host Devil", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +9, Escape Artist +9, Fly +11, Perception +6, Stealth +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Hell", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "superior grappler, shared senses, swarming", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +7, Will +0", "Melee": "mwk spear +7 (1d8+1), 2 claws +6 (1d4+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., fly 60 ft.
