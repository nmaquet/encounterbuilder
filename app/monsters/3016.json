In the outer planes, he is often encountered in his amoeba form or that of a great golden slaad.</p><p>The Slaad Lord of the Insane generally covers an area about 5 feet wide and feet tall, but being similar in makeup to an ooze, can flatten his form and cover a greater area or squeeze through openings much smaller than would normally be allowed. His tentacles are 10 feet long.</p><p>The Slaad Lord of the Insane attacks using his spell-like abilities and slam attacks. His natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields, are considered chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. His natural weapons are considered epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Credit Ssendam, the Slaad Lord of the Insane originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Charles Stross.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Daemonic, Draconic, Goblin, Infernal, Slaadi, Terran, Undercommon, telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Lord of the Insane plus 1-2 death slaadi)", "Ref": "28", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(40d10+600)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 36, Dex 22, Con 40, Int 26, Wis 26, Cha 26", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.
