This deals 2d6+19 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent must succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude save or be stunned for one round. A jack-in-irons can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Shake the Earth (Ex)</b> As a standard action, a jack-in-irons can stomp its foot on the ground causing powerful vibrations to radiate out around the giant. Any creature within 5 feet of the jack-in-irons must succeed on a DC 36 Reflex save or fall prone. The save DC is Strength-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The jacks-in irons enjoy fastening gate chains and portcullis chains around their wrists, fore-arms and shins and tie chains about their throats, shoulders and waists which hang with the heads of their many victims.</p><p>Jacks-in-irons frequently operate as highwaymen, making their dwellings in ruined towers along abandoned roads. From this base they roam out along old country trails ambushing unwary travelers, trade caravans and the knights assigned to protect them. They are known to take prisoners and hold them for high ransom.</p><p>Orcs and goblins often follow a jack-in-irons as their king or leader due to its massive size, brute strength, and penchant for wickedness-all of which are things that such evil creatures admire.</p><p>A jack-in-irons stands 20 to 25 feet tall and weighs 13,000 to 15,000 pounds. It prefers to dress in dark colors such as black or brown and always wears a multitude of chains about its body (as bracelets, necklaces, or slung about its shoulders). Its hair is dark and matted and many male jack-in-irons sport thick, bushy beards. Its eyes are purplish-black with light green irises.</p><p>Jack-in-irons speak Giant.</p><p>Bull rush, Awesome blow, bash, bash, bash, cleave, rinse and repeat if necessary until they are out of attacks or out of enemies. Jacks-in-irons think of themselves as invincible and fight to the death.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(26d8+204)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 36, Dex 12, Con 26, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 11", "Gear": "spiked greatclub, great chain", "Ranged": "rock +19 (2d6+19)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2633, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Cleave, Endurance, Greater Bull Rush, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Sunder, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Martial Weapon Proficiency (great chain), Martial Weapon Proficiency (greatclub), Power Attack, Weapon Focus (greatclub) , Weapon Focus (chain)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "23", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "28, touch 9, flat-footed 27", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Jack-in-irons Giant", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +18, Intimidate +25, Perception +27, Survival +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "12", "Race": "", "CR": "17", "XP": 102400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate plains and forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +23, Ref +11, Will +12", "Melee": "spiked greatclub +31/+26/+21/+16 (3d8+19 plus daze) or great chain +31/+26/+21/+16 (2d8+13 plus daze) or 2 slams +30 (2d6+13 plus daze)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Huge"}
