They can move upright or on all fours. They spend most of their time scooting about their community doing many of the same tasks that humans employ in their own communities.</p><p>A grippli stands 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs from 40 to 50 pounds.</p><p>Its eyes are yellow with vertical-slit pupils of black. Gripplis often wear brightly colored or decorated clothes. They are attracted to and love brightly colored items.</p><p>Gripplis are peaceful and nonaggressive, only attacking when threatened or frightened. They prefer to keep their opponents at distance and attack using their nets and darts. If engaged in melee, gripplis employ short swords. Some gripplis coat their darts with poison before entering battle.</p><p>A grippli village is human-like in organization. Each grippli family maintains its own dwelling place. The huts are small and constructed of wood and mud. Gripplis build them beneath the branches of large trees so as to shade themselves from the long, hot days. Each grippli village is led by a tribal leader (usually a female adept or cleric of at least 3rd level).</p><p>Gripplis survive through trade with other peace-loving races such as elves and halflings or through hunting. Gripplis are fond of various fruits and insects (including the giant varieties) and collect and store them in village huts for the winter months when food becomes scarce. Gripplis reproduce by laying eggs. A typical clutch contains a single egg, as gripplis are slow to reproduce. For this reason, they defend their young with a ferocity unknown among many other races.<br><b>Grippli Characters</b><br></br> Grippli leaders are usually rogues or rogue/fighters.
