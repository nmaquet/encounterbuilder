When they have chosen a village or town to plunder, they attack as a gang and share the spoils.</p><p>A freshwater merrow is 12 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.</p><p>Saltwater merrows easily reach 20 feet tall and 4,000 pounds, and have been known to hunt whales. The two species do not often come in contact, but when they do, feuding and conf lict are swift to develop.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, gang (3-4), or family (5-16)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 18, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "javelin +6 (1d8+4)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1293, "SubType": "(aquatic, giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth in water", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Merrow, Freshwater", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +5, Stealth +2 (+6 in water), Swim +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate lakes or rivers", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +5, Will +3", "Melee": "2 claws +6 (1d6+4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Large"}
