A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing cannot be flanked. </h5><h5><b>Lure-Growth (Ex)</b> A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can sprout a small furry animal from its stump as a free action. It uses this ability to lure potential prey into range where it then attacks with its tentacles. A creature viewing the lure-growth must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom check to detect the deception. The check DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is perhaps the single strangest monster sages have cataloged to date. It appears as a gray-brown tree stump about 3-4 feet in diameter. Two 10-foot long eyestalks protrude from the creature's base. Each eyestalk is brownish-green in color and is topped by a violet flower-like eye. Seven to ten root tentacles, black-brown in color, give the monster its means of locomotion. Its mouth is located on its trunk-like body and appears to be nothing more than a deep scar, except when the creature opens it. The mouth is lined with razor-sharp and jagged greenish-white teeth. Its strangest and perhaps deadliest characteristic is its ability to \"sprout\" a growth on its top that resembles a small furry animal (such as a rabbit or squirrel). The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing uses this ability to lure in its prey, when it strikes with deadly force and aim.</p><p>The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing uses its lure-growth ability to draw in prey.</p><p>When a creature moves within 10 feet of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing, it lashes out with a tentacle. If it hits, it drags the prey to its mouth and bites until the creature dies.</p><p>Credit The Wolf-In-Sheep's-Clothing originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1980) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary,", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d8+44)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 10, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.
