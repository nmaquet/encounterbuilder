The cloud fills a 10-ft. cube and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Burn (Ex)</b> The claws of an obsidian minotaur deal 1d6 points of fire damage each time they hit. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of fire damage for 1d4+1 rounds as clothes ignite and armor becomes searing hot. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> An obsidian minotaur is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below. A <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell <i>slow</i>s it (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while <i>transmute mud to rock</i> heals all of its hit points. A <i>stone to flesh</i> spell does not actually change the obsidian minotaur's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The obsidian minotaur is often employed by spellcasters as a guardian or killer and can be found performing such tasks. When employed as an assassin, the obsidian minotaur is quite effective, first striking fear into the heart of its opponent and then slaying it with no thought or consequence.</p><p>An obsidian minotaur stands 12 feet tall and weighs roughly 2,000 pounds.</p><p>As a guardian, the obsidian minotaur activates when trespassers enter an area it is programmed to protect. As an assassin, it actively hunts down the targeted victim. The creature attacks with its powerful claws, slashing and ripping its opponent's flesh. Against powerful foes, it employs its breath weapon.</p><p><br><b>Construction</b><br> An obsidian minotaur is sculpted from 2,500 pounds of black obsidian worth at least 3,000 gp.<br><b>OBSIDIAN MINOTAUR</b> <br><b>CL</b> 16th; <b>Price</b> 53,000 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>burning hands</i>, <i>cat's grace</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, creator must be caster level 16th; <b>Skill</b> Craft (sculptures) DC 17 or Craft (masonry) DC 17; <b>Cost</b> 28,000 gp Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2905, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "25, touch 9, flat-footed 25", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Obsidian Minotaur", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +4, Will +4", "Melee": "2 claws +17 (2d8+6 plus 1d6 fire)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
