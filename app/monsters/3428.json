This requires the widow creeper to succeed on a ranged touch attack with a +11 bonus to hit. A creature hit by the vines is entangled. An entangled creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a full-round action to make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Fluid Drain (Ex)</b> A widow creeper can suck brain fluids from a living creature by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains brain fluid, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1 point of Intelligence damage each round that it maintains the hold. </h5><h5><b>Improved Woodland Stride (Su)</b> A widow creeper can move through any sort of undergrowth (natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering other impairment. This includes thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion. </h5><h5><b>Plantsense (Ex)</b> A widow creeper can automatically pinpoint the location of anything within 120 feet that is in contact with vegetation.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Widow creepers are spider-like plant creatures that make their lairs deep in tangled forests. They constantly harass woodsmen, foresters, and denizens of the forests from their weed-like webs which they spin high in the tree tops.</p><p>Widow creepers spend much of their time in their nests, venturing forth only to feed, and even then, they rarely venture far from their lair.</p><p>They prefer to lure potential prey to them by rustling nearby leaves or underbrush.</p><p>A widow creeper sustains itself on a diet of brain fluid and blood.</p><p>Corpses drained of blood and fluids are left where they fall; the widow creeper does not devour the flesh, bones, or muscle of its prey.</p><p>A widow creeper is 8 feet tall and looks like a giant black widow formed from leaves, weeds, and tangled brush. It is dark greenish-brown in color.</p><p>Two long, sinewy vine-like tentacles protrude from its body and aid the creature in capturing and securing its prey.</p><p>A widow creeper utters no sounds and cannot speak any known languages.</p><p>Widow creepers are ambush hunters, waiting in their vine-like webs for a creature to pass nearby. When a potential meal comes close to its nest the widow creeper leaps from hiding and attacks. It uses its tentacles to either slash its foe or grapple it. Against a grappled foe, a widow creeper stabs one of its long tentacles into the opponent's head and attempts to drain its brain fluids. While grappling a foe, the widow creeper uses its <i>control plants</i> and entangle attacks to keep any other opponents at bay.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(17d8+102)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 27, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "10 ft.
