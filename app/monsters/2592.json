They are generally non-aggressive creatures and spend their time eating the heated rocks and plants found in the abovementioned planes. Food not eaten is carried and stored in their lair, which takes the form of a large burrow under the fiery waters or on the shores near their \"water source.\" Such burrows are sometimes very large and can contain up to 20 of these creatures. On the Material Plane, fire crabs lair in volcanoes and near hot springs.</p><p>Fire crabs have large claws and in males, one claw is always larger (at least three times larger) than the other. Fire crabs have six segmented and spindly legs, blackish-red in color.</p><p>Fire crabs are highly territorial and defend their lair with great ferocity.</p><p>Normally non-aggressive creatures, if their lair is threatened, they fight to the death. Against weaker prey, fire crabs usually just slash with their claws. Stronger foes are grabbed and squeezed by the fire crab. Once they grab an opponent, they hold on, allowing their fires to engulf the foe.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, cluster (2-5), or colony (6-11)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8 +12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 11, Con 16, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2592, "SubType": "(extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Focus (claw)B", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "16, touch 9, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Greater Fire Crab", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +4, Stealth +0, Swim +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Plane of Molten Skies or Elemental Plane of Fire", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +1, Will +1", "Melee": "2 claws +7 (1d6 +4 plus 1d8 fire plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
