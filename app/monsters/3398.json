This effect is permanent, but can be dispelled if the rock troll is removed from the source of the sunlight and <i>stone to flesh</i> is cast on it. A rock troll must make a new saving throw each round it remains in sunlight.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Rock trolls are relatives of the normal troll and make their lairs deep within the subterranean realms of the earth. Most underground creatures avoid rock trolls, as they are completely malign and evil, attacking any living creature, especially when hungry. They are quite fond of human and halfling flesh. Unlike common trolls, rock trolls cannot regenerate lost limbs (though they do possess the ability to quickly heal damage).</p><p>Rock trolls are 10 feet tall and weigh about 600 pounds. They resemble their smaller relatives in most respects. The rock troll's hide is stone gray or brown, its hair is black or brown, and its eyes are dull brown.</p><p>Rock trolls attack any living thing that enters their territory, usually doing so for food. They have no strategy or organization in their attacks; a rock troll flails relentlessly at its foes with its powerful claws until either it or its opponent is dead.<br><b>Rock Troll Characters</b><br> Rock trolls have racial Hit Dice and can have class levels.
