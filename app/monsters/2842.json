Any living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural feelings of hopelessness. A powerful curse falls upon the victim and they become so despondent that they need to make a successful DC 16 Concentration check in order to motivate themselves enough to make an attack or cast spell. The curse is permanent, though a <i>remove curse</i> or <i>break enchantment</i> (both requiring a successful caster level check against DC 18) or a <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>wish</i>, or <i>miracle</i> can remove the effects of curse. The save DC is Charisma-based. Whether or not the save is successful, an individual cannot be affected by a murderborn's despondent wail for the next 24 hours. </h5><h5><b>Sense Living (Su)</b> A murder-born can detect living creatures to a range of 100 feet. This functions as a <i>detect evil</i> spell (caster level 8th) except it detects the presence of life rather than a particular alignment. There is no chance the murder-born to be stunned and it is not blocked by stone, wood, or any other material.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Spawned of hatred when both mother and child are murdered, the rapacious soul of the unborn sometimes rises as a foul and corrupt spirit.</p><p>It is bent on exacting revenge against its killers and against all living creatures it crosses. Driven mad by its unliving existence, the murderborn has blurred its senses into believing that every living creature is responsible for its current state and it never hesitates to attack any that come within range of it.</p><p>A murder-born is always encountered within 500 feet of the place it was killed, and can never move further away than that. It is a solitary creature, though very rarely, when twins are involved, two of these cursed creatures may be encountered together. Neither is aware of the other's presence; they do not communicate, interact, or even see each other.</p><p>They are oblivious to the other's existence. Whether this is because the creatures are so driven with rage it blinds them, or because some magical and mystical force prevents them from interacting is unknown. Murderborns do not speak or communicate but seem to understand a variety of languages.</p><p>A murder-born closes quickly when it detects living creatures in its realm. Once it and at least one opponent are within 60 feet of one another, it unleashes its despondent wail. It then moves to melee range and uses its incorporeal touch to destroy its enemies. Unless driven away or its opponents flee, a murder-born attacks relentlessly until it is destroyed.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, any two other languages (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d8+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 15, Con -, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2842, "SubType": "(incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-FightB, Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 17, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Murder-born", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +9, Fly +17, Intimidate +12, Perception +11, Sense Motive +11, Stealth +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +7", "Melee": "incorporeal touch +9 (1d6 Cha)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 40 ft.
