They slay their victims, steal their possessions, and leave their bodies to what ever happens to wander along looking for a meal. Cruel, mean-spirited creatures, silids care nothing for themselves or anything else. They seem to take great pleasure in bringing misery to others, particularly adventurers. Silids rarely interact with other races.</p><p>They are an untrustworthy lot, and most other races avoid contact with them.</p><p>Silids live in groups (called stripes) of up to 40 individuals. Each stripe is a loose organization of silids, with a single leader that controls and governs the remainder of the stripe. The leader is almost always the meanest, cruelest, and sneakiest silid of the bunch. Under his command, the silids conduct raids and hunt their subterranean realm for surfacedwellers that have wandered into their territory. When hunting or harassing travelers, silids often don armor (either leather or padded) and carry weapons.</p><p>Silids skulk about their underground world in search of surfacedwellers.</p><p>Surface-dwellers seem to love exploring the Underdark, so there rarely is a shortage of opponents for the mean-spirited silid. Often, a band of silids trails an adventuring party before attacking; waiting until the terrain is just right (silids prefer small, cramped areas because they gain the advantage on larger opponents). When the attack commences, a silid <i>blur</i>s itself and usually employs one of the following tactics.</p><p>The silids attack from ambush, attempting to maim or kill as many of their opponents as they can. Or, the silids rush from all angles and swarm their opponents. The latter tactic is usually only used when a large group of silids are present (such as when a party of adventurers stumbles into a silid lair).<br><b>Silids Characters</b><br> Silids are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice.
