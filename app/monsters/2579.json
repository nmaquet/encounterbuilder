The residue is then absorbed into the dragon's body. An assimilated creature can only be restored to life using <i>wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>true resurrection</i>, but even then, there is a 50% chance that such powerful magic fails. </h5><h5><b>Breath Weapon (Su)</b> An elemental earth dragon's breath weapon is a 50 ft. cone of scorching sand and gravel. </h5><h5><b>Earth Mastery (Ex)</b> An elemental earth dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foes are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental earth dragon takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the stat block.) </h5><h5><b>Freeze (Ex)</b> An elemental earth dragon can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice that the elemental earth dragon is really alive. </h5><h5><b>Meld into Stone (Ex)</b> An elemental earth dragon can meld its body with any stone surface large enough to accommodate its entire body. This is a standard action and has an unlimited duration (the dragon can stay melded as long as it desires). It otherwise resembles the <i>meld into stone</i> spell (caster level 20th).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Elemental earth dragons are the strongest of the elemental dragons.</p><p>Using their great stone tail or earthen claws, they can destroy almost anything in short order. The majority of their time is spent burrowing through the Plane of Earth devouring gems, minerals, and silicate life forms. On occasion, they are summoned to the Material Plane by evil (and foolish) spellcasters who usually live just long enough to regret their mistake. Elemental earth dragons are evil (perhaps the most evil of the elemental dragons in addition to being the strongest) and despise most other forms of life. They rarely associate with other creatures, though a few have been known to have dealings with the occasional earth elemental. Elemental earth dragons cannot enter water; they must burrow under it or walk around it. The average elemental earth dragon is 30 feet long. Its roar can be heard up to 5 miles away.</p><p>Elemental earth dragons prefer to attack from ambush and secret rather than using a direct frontal assault. An elemental earth dragon lies in wait using its <i>freeze</i> ability or <i>meld into stone</i> ability and springs to attack when its prey comes into range. They are also fond of burrowing into the ground and surfacing under their prey, thereby gaining total surprise.</p><p>Slain opponents are processed and absorbed into the body of the elemental earth dragon.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Terran", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "14", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(24d10+120)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 35, Dex 10, Con 20, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.
