A chuul-ttaen is considered invisible (+40 Stealth or +20 Stealth when moving) when encountered in the dark by a creature using darkvision. In lit areas, a chuul-ttaen appears as a ghostly white surface-dwelling chuul. </h5><h5><b>Larvae Spray (Ex)</b> Once per week as a free action, a female chuul-ttaen can release a spray (15-foot cone) of minute barbed larvae. The initial blast deals 1d8 points of damage and injects larvae into the opponent's body. The affected creature must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save to avoid implantation. The save DC is Constitution based. If a chuul-ttaen implants larvae into a paralyzed or otherwise helpless creature, it gets no saving throw. The larvae pupate over the course of 10 days. The host becomes increasing ill suffering a -1 to Strength, Constitution and Dexterity each day of the pupation (-10 maximum) as the pupae absorb nutrients. At the end of the 10 day gestation, 2d4 Diminutive chuul-ttaen burst from the host, killing it in the process. A <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell rids a victim of the larvae/ pupae as does a DC 25 Heal check. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient. The ability score damage heals normally after the larvae/pupae have been removed. </h5><h5><b>Paralytic Tentacles (Ex)</b> A chuul-ttaen can transfer a grappled victim from a claw to its tentacles as a move action. The tentacles grapple with the same strength as the claw but deal no damage, instead exuding a paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the tentacles must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save each round on the chuul-ttaen\u2018s turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes1d8+7 points of damage each round from the creature's mandibles.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Chuul-ttaens are similar to their normal chuul cousins, possessing many of the same skills, attacks and defenses. The ttaen versions are said to swim in the cold depths of the world and only find their way to the surface when summoned by particularly vile wizards. Others claim they are simply underground albino versions of a normal chuul - albeit a more intelligent and deadly monstrosity. The heavily armored chuul-ttaens are excellent swimmers, and often rise up from the depths to grab land-bound creatures in their claws and tentacles. Some scholars say the ttaen addition to their names is a designation of royalty or a higher ranking in chuul society, although this has not been confirmed. The ttaens are able to communicate more easily with other races via a raspy Common speech. Chuul-ttaens have little interest in conversation, however, and are much more likely to attack before asking questions. Only extremely powerful foes give them pause and might warrant words before weapons. Underground races fear the chuul-ttaens, claiming the hideous creatures were bred to wipe out all life in the tunnels under the land. They are perfect assassins and even the deadly drow fear these versions that can hide from darkvision.
