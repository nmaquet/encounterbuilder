The target must be within 30 feet, and can resist this effect with a successful DC 12 Will save-otherwise, the target becomes confused for as long as the grioth concentrates plus 1 additional round after it ceases concentrating, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 3 plus the Grioth's total HD (5 rounds for most grioths). This is a mind-affecting effect, and is equivalent to a 2nd-level spell. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Mindshock (Su)</b> When a grioth damages a creature with a voidglass weapon, a surge of the grioth's violent psychic energy pulses through the weapon, causing an additional 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. On a critical hit, the creature struck must also succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be confused for 1d2 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 12; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> shaken for 1 round; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Grioths inhabit rogue planets that have been cast away from the stars. They often travel via portals to other worlds via that are undergoing eclipses to pillage resources that are rare on their frozen homeworlds. Many members of this evil race are known for their devotion to the Outer God Nyarlathotep (whom they worship in his guise as the Haunter of the Dark), and it isn't uncommon for colonies of grioths to be led by his clerics. Grioths' voices are raspy and dry. They favor weaponry crafted from a strange material known as voidglass (see page 35). The grioth race is prone to mutations, their forms twisted by the eldritch forces within the Dark Tapestry into lumbering giants or deformed horrors. Some grioths grow unusually large and ferocious, and the elders of the race possesses unusual and deadly psychic powers- abilities that aid them in ruling their dark spire cities and in their constant war against their hated foes, the entities of the Dominion of the Black.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Grioth; telepathy 30 ft.", "Source": "The Dragon's Demand", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, gathering (3-6 plus 1 3rd-level cleric), or cult (7-20 plus 2-6 3rd-level clerics, 2-4 3rd-level barbarians, and 1 7th-level cleric)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d10+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4692, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception in darkness", "AC": "14, touch 14, flat-footed 10", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Grioth", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +9, Knowledge (geography) +3, Perception +6 (+10 in darkness), Sense Motive +3, Stealth +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "no breath", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +7, Will +6", "Melee": "mwk voidglass kukri +3 (1d4+1/18-20 plus 1d4 nonlethal), bite -3 (1d6 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 40 ft.
