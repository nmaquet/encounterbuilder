This deals 1 point of Constitution damage to the victim per minute until the victim dies or the blood poisoning is healed. A <i>neutralize poison</i> or <i>remove disease</i> spell rids the victim of blood poisoning, as does a DC 15 Heal check. Multiple wounds to the same foe do not result in multiple instances of blood poisoning. The save DC and check DC are both Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Grave risen are rotting undead creatures that upon first glance resemble zombies. They are created from a normal corpse in an area where the blood of a spellcaster is spilled and permeates the ground. The blood fuses with a corpse which sometimes animates as a grave risen. These creatures rarely wander far from the area where they were risen, preferring the stench of death and the serenity of death that lingers in the air.</p><p>Grave risen have no love for the living and attack living creatures on sight. Living creatures slain by a grave risen are clawed and mutilated and then buried in a shallow grave by the grave risen as a mockery of its own current existence.</p><p>Grave risen do not speak or communicate; only occasionally loosing guttural tones from their rotting vocal organs.</p><p>Since grave risen are rarely encountered anywhere but cemeteries, burial grounds, or the like, they usually begin combat by animating corpses and sending them against their aggressors. After animating corpses, the grave risen attempts to down its foes with its filthy claws. Slain foes are destroyed (as detailed above) and are not consumed by a grave risen.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (1 grave risen plus 2-5 zombies)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+15 plus 5)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 15, Con -, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2663, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Toughness, Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 12, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Grave Risen", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +7, Climb +10, Escape Artist +7, Perception +10, Stealth +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +3, Will +6", "Melee": "2 claws +6 (1d4+2 plus blood poisoning)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
