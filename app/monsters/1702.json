While under this effect, the creature takes a -4 penalty on all Will saving throws, and will not willingly travel farther than a mile from the area where it failed its saving throw against that colour's aura of lassitude. A <i>break enchantment</i> spell (DC 22) ends the effect, as does removing the victim from the aura's area of effect. Every 24 hours, a creature affected by an aura of lassitude can attempt a new DC 22 Will save to throw off the effects of the aura. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to that colour's aura of lassitude for 24 hours, and a creature that is under the effects of an aura of lassitude from a colour out of space cannot be further affected by this ability from other colours. This is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Disintegrating Touch (Su</b>) A colour's touch causes a terrible disintegration of flesh and bone. A DC 22 Fortitude save halves the damage caused by a colour out of space's touch attack. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a colour out of space's touch attack must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or be immediately slain and reduced to a pile of fine ash. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Feed (Su</b>) A colour can attempt to feed on any living creature or a region of plant life as a full-round action. If it feeds on a single creature, the colour must have line of sight and be within 300 feet of the target. If it feeds on a region of plant and animal life, it need only be within that region. It can attempt to feed on a region once per week, and upon a living creature at will (but only once per day per living creature). Feeding on a region of plant life is automatically successful, blighting that region of plant life as if via a <i>diminish plants</i> spell used to stunt growth. A creature can resist being fed upon by a colour out of space by making a successful DC 22 Will save-if the save is successful, the colour must wait 24 hours before attempting to feed on that creature again. If this saving throw fails, the victim takes 1d4 points of ability drain to Charisma and Constitution. If a creature is drained to 0 points of Constitution by a colour out of space's feed attack, it dies, crumbling into a mass of desiccated tissue. If a creature is drained to 0 points of Charisma by a colour out of space's feed attack, it gains the colour-blighted simple template (see facing page). Every time a colour successfully feeds on a creature, it gains 1 growth point. A colour out of space can never have more than 100 growth points-it can expend 100 growth points after spending 24 hours concentrating on its growth, and in so doing gains 1 permanent Hit Die. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Susceptible to Force Effects (Ex</b>) A colour out of space takes half again as much damage (+50%) from force effects, and takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws to resist force effects. A colour out of space cannot damage force effects with its disintegrating touch. Its aura of lassitude and feed ability is blocked if the colour is completely entrapped by force effects (such as by a windowless cell version of <i>forcecage</i> or a <i>telekinetic</i> sphere).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The deepest, strangest parts of the Dark Tapestry hold truly alien concepts, and of those, few are more notorious than the colour out of space. The lack of a physical body does little to impede this deadly alien lifeform's ability to cause incredible devastation. The fact that its life cycle requires periodic visits from the deepest reaches of space to gestate and grow in the vicinity of powerful gravitational fields such as those created by planets only increases the monster's opportunities to bring ruin to countless worlds.</p><p>The colour out of space is just that-a mobile radiance.</p><p>Its glow is unlike any seen in nature, and while those few who encounter one of these creatures and survive to tell the tale may describe the radiance or depict it in art as a sinister green-gray illumination, these depictions are flawed reproductions. To witness the colour out of space is to know there are things no humanoid mind can fully comprehend, describe, or explain.<b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> Very little is known about the life cycle of a colour that dwells in the depths of space, for it is only when they come to a planet to grow and reproduce that other lifeforms encounter them. A colour's arrival upon a world is typically via a small meteorite strike-the colour itself infuses this meteorite, and shortly after the falling star's arrival, the rock crumbles away to expose the semisolid mass of a larval colour that seeps into the surrounding landscape.</p><p>Although a colour is incorporeal, and thus able to move through solid objects, it can also exist as a free-f loating eerie radiance. Natural sunlight doesn't particularly harm colours out of space, but they prefer to dwell in darkened areas like deep caves or abandoned wells where their own radiance has little or no competition. Over the course of several weeks, months, or even years, the colour feeds upon the surrounding plant and animal life-the act of this feeding is weirdly addictive to its victims, who over time develop a self-destructive lassitude that prevents flight from the region. When a colour has absorbed enough life to grow to full maturity (usually signified by reaching 25 to 30 Hit Dice), it gathers its strength and erupts from its den, coruscating into the sky as it launches the majority of itself back into space to continue its unknowable existence in the Dark Tapestry. Sometimes, enough remains of the parent colour to survive on its own, and in these cases the life cycle repeats again and again.</p><p>Areas blighted by a colour out of space are singularly recognizable not only for the eerie pallor of local plant life and large swaths of blasted, barren landscape, but by the presence of those the colour has fed from. These unfortunate deformed individuals, known as colour-blighted creatures, never live for long, but while they do, their madness often drives them to unusually violent behavior, be they men or beasts.</p><p><b>Colour-Blighted Simple Template (CR +0)</b><br> A creature with the colour-blighted simple template appears hideously deformed and glows with the same unnamable color as the creature that blighted it. A colour-blighted creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.</p><p><b>Rebuild Rules:</b> A colour-blighted creature's ability scores suffer drain as a result of being fed upon by a colour out of space, but once a creature gains this template, it becomes immune to further feed attacks from colours out of space until it loses the colour-blighted simple template. A Charisma score drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack is raised to 1; other ability scores are not altered. In order to remove this simple template from a creature, one need only restore all of its drained ability scores to normal.</p><p>As long as a creature suffers the colour-blighted template, it becomes strangely aggressive toward creatures that do not exude the colors of a colour out of space, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against such targets. Every 24 hours, a creature suffering from this simple template must make a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist crumbling into fine white ash-such a doom means instant death and, for many color-blighted creatures, their only chance at escape from a life filled with pain.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "AP 46", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "14", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d8+72)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 26, Con 22, Int 19, Wis 23, Cha 23", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1702, "SubType": "(incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Spring Attack, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 23, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Colour Out of Space", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +27, Knowledge (geography) +16, Knowledge (nature) +16, Knowledge (planes) +16, Perception +18, Stealth +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +14, Will +10", "Melee": "disintegrating touch +15 (6d6; DC 22)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 50 ft.
