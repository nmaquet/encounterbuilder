It rerolls for each ongoing mind-affecting effect each turn. </h5><h5><b>Earth Bond (Ex)</b> A mythic hill giant gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saves while touching the ground (including a stone or earthen floor in a building). As a standard action, a hill giant touching the ground can expend one use of mythic power to rejuvenate itself, gaining the benefits of <i>cure critical wounds</i> and <i>restoration</i>. </h5><h5><b>Ground Pound (Ex)</b> As a standard action, a mythic hill giant can expend one use of mythic power and hit the ground with a bludgeoning weapon. Choose one intersection within reach; creatures touching the ground within a 20-foot burst centered on that intersection take double the damage normally dealt by that bludgeoning weapon (Reflex DC 23 for half). Creatures that fail their saves are knocked prone and moved 5 feet directly away from chosen intersection. This ability has no effect on creatures with the earth bond ability. The save DC is Strength-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A mythic hill giant is a relic from an earlier age, smarter than its degenerate kin and gifted with magic of stone and earth.
