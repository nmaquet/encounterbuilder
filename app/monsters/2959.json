It loses this invisibility and remains visible for 1 round in any round in which it takes any action other than a free action. </h5><h5><b>Poison Use (Ex)</b> A quickling is never at risk of poisoning itself when handling poison. They usually use kava leaf poison on their daggers. </h5><h5><b>Supernatural Speed (Su)</b> A quickling moves with incredible speed. Save for when it remains motionless (at which point it is invisible), a quickling's shape blurs and shimmers with this speed, granting it concealment (20% miss chance). In addition, this ability grants the quickling evasion and uncanny dodge (as the rogue abilities of the same name). </h5><h5><b>Slow Susceptibility (Ex)</b> A quickling that succumbs to a slow effect loses its supernatural speed ability and is sickened.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Believed to be the offspring of an elf and a brownie (see that entry), the quickling is an evil faerie creature that hates all other races (especially the other fey races). How they came to be evil and malign is still a mystery, but legend speaks of the first quicklings as being great sorcerers. Elven scholars believe these quickling sorcerers unleashed some spark of the arcane that was never meant for mortal creatures.</p><p>Quicklings resemble small elves with large ears that rise to points above their heads. Their skin is pale blue to blue-white and hair is either silver or white. They prefer clothes of bright and boisterous colors; reds, yellows, silvers, blacks, and blues are among their favorites. Quicklings never wear armor.</p><p>Quicklings speak Common and Aklo. Both are spoken so quickly that even those able to speak one of the languages may still find it difficult to converse with a quickling.</p><p>Because of their rapid metabolism, quicklings reach adulthood by the age of 2, middle age at 5, old age at 12, and venerable at age 15.</p><p>No creature can match the natural speed and agility of a quickling. It knows this, and uses its great speed to its advantage in combat. A quickling often rushes an opponent, stabs it with its dagger, and then retreats out of melee range before an opponent can react.</p><p>Kava Leaf Poison: <i>Type</i> ingestion or injury; save DC 15; frequency 1/min. for 2 min.; effect sleep 1 hour; cure 1 save.</p><p>Credit The Quickling originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-4) or band (4-11 plus 1 6-HD leader)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 8, Dex 24, Con 11, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 14", "Gear": "5 doses of kava leaf poison; Other Gear dagger", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2959, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, MobilityB, Spring AttackB, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception, +8 Stealth in natural surroundings", "AC": "19, touch 19, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Quickling", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +14 (+50 jump), Bluff +9, Craft (any one) +9, Escape Artist +14, Knowledge (nature) +9, Perception +11, Stealth +18 (+26 in natural surroundings), Survival +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "poison", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +11, Will +6", "Melee": "dagger +10 (1d3-1/19-20 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "120 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Small"}
