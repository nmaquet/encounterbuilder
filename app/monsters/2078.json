It can retain this stored power for up to 1 minute, during which time its tattoos glow with blue fire. If it damages a target with a successful hit using a melee or ranged weapon, it can cast the spell on the target as a free action, as if it were using a <i>spell storing weapon</i>. This spell uses the caster level and DC of the original caster. This discharges the stored spell. </h5><h5><b>Warding Tattoos (Su)</b> A jungle giant's magical tattoos grant it a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. The giant loses this bonus if it wears armor.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Reclusive by nature, jungle giants lair deep within the rainforest. These giants distrust the ways of civilization and resent trespassers. More than one vine-covered lost city in the deep jungle owes its fall to jungle giant ire. The warrior-women of these tribes usually fight with bows, sacred weapons often passed down over generations from mother to daughter. To touch a jungle giant's bow without permission is a mortal insult. Jungle giants stand 17 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. Their barklike skin bears runic brands etched into each giant as a rite of passage into adulthood. Jungle giant tribes are matriarchal, ruled by an elder female warrior. Males traditionally defend the village, gather food, tend livestock, and raise children.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Giant", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 3", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, hunting party (2-9 plus 1-3 girallons), or tribe (10-40, plus 35% noncombatants, 1-3 druids or sorcerers of 2nd-5th level, 1 ranger or barbarian of 3rd-7th level, and 2-8 girallons)", "Ref": "13", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(15d8+60)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 19, Con 19, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "mwk composite longbow +15/+10/+5 (3d6+8/19-20/x3)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2078, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Deadly Aim, Improved Critical (longbow), Improved Precise Shot, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Skill Focus (Stealth), Weapon Focus (longbow)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Climb, +8 Stealth in forests", "AC": "24, touch 16, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Jungle Giant", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +12, Craft (bows) +8, Perception +15, Stealth +12 (+20 in forests), Survival +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "archery expert", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +13, Will +7", "Melee": "2 slams +17 (2d6+8)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
