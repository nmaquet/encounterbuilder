This acid quickly falls and covers a 10-foot-radius burst around the fountain fungus. Creatures in the area take 7d6 points of acid damage. A DC 21 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Camouflage (Ex)</b> Since a fountain fungus looks like a normal moss-covered fountain when at rest, a DC 20 Perception check is required to notice it before it attacks for the first time. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use either of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A fountain fungus is a semi-intelligent plant creature that enjoys luring other creatures to their doom and then devouring them. While it appears to be an ordinary fountain carved of stone and covered with mold and vegetation, the fountain fungus is 100% vegetable matter through and through. The gray coloration of its central body lends to its deception. Fountain funguses can be found just about anywhere save the coldest of climates. Many are encountered underground as these creatures seem to have a particular like for the dampness and darkness that dungeons and caverns provide. Fountain funguses subsist on a diet of blood, so regardless of where they lair, they always make sure a supply of fresh food is readily available (e.g., a popular dungeon perhaps where adventurers like to explore). When a fountain fungus's food supply dwindles it simply rolls itself into a ball and moves to another location. A fountain fungus is about 10 feet in diameter. Its central body is stone gray with many vines, leaves, and mushroom-like growths of varying greens covering it. Somewhere in this tangled mass are four tentacles that look like thick rugged vines. A fountain fungus's tactics are simple: spray acid on foes, slap and whip foes with its tendrils, and finally grab an opponent and attempt to swallow it. Creatures killed by a fountain fungus are wrapped in its vines and pulled into its body. The fountain fungus spends the next few days absorbing all fluids and nutrients from its prey before ejecting a dried out husk of its victim onto the ground.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d8+60)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 25, Dex 13, Con 20, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "10 ft.
