Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the sand kraken. </h5><h5><b>Tentacles (Ex)</b> The only part of a sand kraken that is normally exposed is its tentacles. For combat purposes, the creature's tentacles are treated as separate weapons. A single tentacle has an AC 20 (touch 14) and 15 hit points. Once a tentacle takes more than 15 hit points of damage, it is destroyed. A sand kraken can no longer use the destroyed tentacle to make attacks, however the loss of a tentacle cause the creature no other penalties. Furthermore, damage dealt to a tentacle does not count against the creature's total hit points. Lost tentacles regrow in 1d4 days.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The sand krakens are dangerous creatures encountered only in remote wastelands. A sand kraken keeps its body well concealed, buried deep in sand or loose rock, and inaccessible to most attacks. The creature never moves from the place where it digs its first burrow and once it settles in, will never again see the light of day. The only parts of a sand kraken that are usually seen are its tentacles, and by then it is often too late.</p><p>Sand krakens are omnivores, but prefer meat to any other food. Once it captures and kills its prey, it pulls the carcass down into its sandy lair, and devours it with its great central maw. For this reason, a number of scholars speculate a biological relationship between sand krakens and dustdiggers.</p><p>For most of its life, a sand kraken remains dormant and silent, buried several feet below the surface of the ground. When it senses prey its tentacles swiftly rise to the surface. A sand kraken uses its initial attacks to immobilize its prey by constriction. Each tentacle has its own secondary brain, and can attack independently. While tentacles can be harmed and severed, the only true way to kill a sand kraken is to dig it up and destroy its body.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+60)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 11, Con 23, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.
