It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter, it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights using the stats below. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the algoid that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. This ability is otherwise similar to <i>liveoak</i>. <br><i>Animated Tree</i>: <b>CR</b> 4; N Huge plant; <b>Init</b> -1; <b>Senses</b> low-light vision; <b>AC</b> 16 (-1 Dex, +9 natural, -2 size), touch 7, flat-footed 16; </h5><h5><b>hp</b> 37 (5d8+15); <b>Saves</b> Fort +7, Ref +0, Will +2; <b>DR</b> 5/slashing; <b>Immune</b> plant traits; <b>Weaknesses</b> vulnerability to fire; <b>Spd</b> 30 ft.; <b>Atk</b> 2 slams +7 (2d6+5); Space/Reach 15 ft./15 ft.; <b>SA</b> double damage against objects (full attack deals double damage), trample (2d6+7, DC 17); Str 21, Dex 8, Con 17, Int 4, Wis 12, Cha 10; <b>BAB</b> +3; <b>CMB</b> +10; CMD 19; <b>Feats</b> Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (slam); <b>Skills</b> Perception +5 </h5><h5><b>Mind Blast (Sp)</b> Once per day, an algoid can use a mind blast in a 60-foot cone. Any creature caught in the cone must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. </h5><h5><b>Stun (Ex)</b> If an algoid scores a critical hit with a slam attack, the opponent struck must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Water (Ex)</b> A <i>control water</i> spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to an algoid (no save).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The algoid is a living colony of algae that has developed some semblance of intelligence and mobility. It is roughly humanoid in shape and resembles a green humanoid. Algoids make their lairs in marshes and swamps. They are often encountered with other marsh-dwelling sentient plants; though never with shambling mounds (they hate them and usually attack them on sight).</p><p>The algoid is 7 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds. In its natural surroundings, it is nearly invisible until it attacks and uses this to its advantage when prey is nearby. The \"skin\" of an algoid is coarse and rough with a leafy texture.</p><p>The algoid often lies in wait, partially submerged in water or a bog, until its prey passes nearby. It springs to attack with its powerful fists when its opponents come within range.</p><p>Credit The Algoid originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Clark Peterson, based on original material by Mike Ferguson.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (can't speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair or cluster (3-6)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+15)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 4, Wis 10, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1847, "SubType": "(fungus, psionic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +4 Stealth (+12 Stealth in swamps and forests)", "AC": "16, touch 10, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Algoid", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +12, Stealth +10 (+18 in swamps and forests)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +1, Will +3", "Melee": "2 slams +8 (1d6+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
