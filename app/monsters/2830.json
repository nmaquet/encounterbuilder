The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Disgorge Vermin (Ex)</b> Once per day as a standard action, a mire brute can vomit forth a spray of fetid water to a range of 30 feet. The spray contains small biting insects and worms. Treat these vermin as a centipede swarm (<i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i> Bestiary). A mire brute disgorges 1d3 centipede swarms when it uses this ability. A swarm moves to engage the closest living creature. </h5><h5><b>Drench (Ex)</b> A mire brute can extinguish torches, campfires, exposed lanterns and other open flames of a nonmagical origin if they are of Large size or smaller. A mire brute can <i>dispel magic</i>al fire as <i>dispel magic</i> (CL 21). </h5><h5><b>Impale (Ex)</b> A mire brute can try to impale a grabbed opponent of one size smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If successful, the opponent immediately takes 4d6 points of damage and is impaled on the stakes jutting from the mire brute's body. An impaled opponent is considered pinned and thereafter takes 3d6 points of damage each round until it breaks free. An impaled opponent must succeed on a grapple check against the mire brute's CMD to break free. A mire brute is not considered grappled while it has an opponent impaled. A Huge mire brute can impale 1 Large, 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 32 Tiny or smaller opponents at one time.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Mire brutes, when dormant, appear as large stretches of mud bristling with wooden stakes. It lies in wait for lone or distracted targets, at which time it rises and attacks, assuming a vaguely humanoid form, its surface glistening with slime and detritus. Lacking any discernible sensory organs, it shambles about, looking to kill anything it detects nearby.</p><p>Towering over 12 feet tall, and of an instable structure, it lurches about, on thick featureless legs, dripping muck over the battlefield. Stupid and destructive, it fights blindly, targeting whatever comes within its reach. The most repellant attack form available to the mire brute is its ability to unleash a slough of putrid fluid, squirming insects and worms.</p><p>Conceivably more of these foul creatures exist, but none have been spotted before and it is believed that this monster is unique.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Terran (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(21d10+168)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 32, Dex 8, Con 26, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2830, "SubType": "(earth, elemental, extraplanar, water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Blinding Critical, Cleave, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Critical (slam), Improved Natural Attack (slam), Iron Will, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "22", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in swamp or marsh terrain.", "AC": "17, touch 7, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Mire Brute", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +14, Intimidate +23, Perception +34, Sense Motive +2, Stealth +15 (+23 in swamps or marshes), Swim +32", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "14", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +22, Ref +6, Will +14", "Melee": "2 slams +31 (3d6+11/19-20 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Huge"}
