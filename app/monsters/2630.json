Affected creatures that succeed on a DC 20 Will save are unaffected and immune to the sardonic laugh of that bronze giant for 24 hours. On a failed save, that creature is shaken for as long as it remains within 100 feet of the bronze giant and for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>These giants are said to by some to have been sired by the Vulcan gods.</p><p>Others claim that they are awakened constructs with the flesh and blood of a living being encased in a skin of pure bronze. Both could be true, for these giants truly do have hardened skin the color of bronze. Due to their unique skin, bronze giants disdain wearing any sort of crafted armor.</p><p>Bronze giants are loners, and tend to avoid large gatherings of their rare kind, seeking mates in volcanic regions, where they remain together long enough to ensure the survival of their progeny, teach them how to fight and then move on.</p><p>All bronze giants claim to be the descendants of mighty Talos and are known to hire themselves out as mercenaries and defenders of cities within eyesight of great volcanoes. More than one hero has sought out a bronze giant for training. They may also serve as heroes and brute force, their appearance on a battlefield often sending would be invaders fleeing.</p><p>Bronze giants stand about 25 feet tall and weigh about 14,000 pounds.</p><p>They have hair of black, copper, red, or dark brown. Their eyes are gray, brown, or black. They speak Common and Giant. Bronze giants live to be 500 years old.</p><p>Bronze giants prefer to dress in loose-fitting garb, such as robes and tunics. Sandals, rather than boots are usually worn on their feet, and many bronze giants wear rings, bracelets, and other jewelry fashioned of silver, bronze, or gold.</p><p>Bronze giants start combat from a distance, hurling large rocks and using spears before closing to fight with fists or sword. When confronted by many foes they let out a self-deprecating laugh that strikes fear into their enemies.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Casey Christofferson.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or family (2-4)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d8+80)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 33, Dex 13, Con 21, Int 10, Wis 16, Cha 14", "Gear": "longsword", "Ranged": "spear +11 (3d6+11) or rock +12 (2d6+16)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2630, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Awesome Blow, Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Martial Weapon Proficiency (longsword), Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 9, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Bronze Giant", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +15, Craft (blacksmithing) +8, Intimidate +19, Perception +22", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate mountains and coastal islands", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +8, Will +10", "Melee": "longsword +21/+16/+11 (3d6+11) or 2 slams +21 (2d6+11)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
