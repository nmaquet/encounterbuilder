An adult specimen is over 40 ft. long and nearly 5 ft. thick in its midsection. In bright light it can be seen to be covered with non-reflective black scales, and its underbelly is the dark red of clotted blood. Shadow hunters have the supernatural ability to blend in with shadows, both to protect themselves and to stalk and ambush prey. Unlike normal snakes, shadow hunters often work in groups of two or three to corner prey in passages.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Shadow Hunter</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 8</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>4,800</h5><h5>N Huge magical beast </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+2; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, scent, tremorsense 60 ft.; Perception +12</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>18, touch 10, flat-footed 16 (+2 Dex, +8 natural, -2 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>76 (8d10+32)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+10, <b>Ref </b>+8, <b>Will </b>+4</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>shadowblend</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +14 (1d8+10 plus poison plus grab)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>15 ft.; <b>Reach </b>10 ft.</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>24, <b>Dex </b>15, <b>Con </b>19, <b>Int </b> 5, <b>Wis </b>14, <b>Cha </b>3</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+8; <b>CMB </b>+17 (+21 grapple); <b>CMD </b>29 (can't be tripped)</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Ability Focus (poison), Skill Focus (Perception), Skill Focus (Stealth), Weapon Focus (bite)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Climb +15, Perception +12, Stealth +4 (+14 in dimly lit & unlit areas), Swim +15; <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+10 racial bonus on Stealth checks in areas of dim or no light.</h5><h5><b>SQ </b>hunt by scent</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> underground</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary, pair, trio, or nest (1-3 adults and 5-8 hatchlings)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div></h5><h5><b>Shadowblend (Su)</b> In areas of dim and no light, shadow hunters gain improved concealment; there is a 40% miss chance when attacking one in such conditions. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> DC 20 Fort; <i>frequency</i> 1/ round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Constitution damage; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s.

They are particularly fond of elf flesh, but eats any Small to Large creature as long as it is living, organic, and animal-based (i.e., not a plant or fungus). When they attack, they prefer to strike and envenom their prey, holding on and chewing the poison into their opponent until it stops struggling. If there is more than one foe present, they do not try to grab their prey, preferring to strike at those that threaten it, retreating if need be to return later to consume their hopefully dead prey.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, trio, or nest (1-3 adults and 5-8 hatchlings)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(8d10+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 15, Con 19, Int 5, Wis 14, Cha 3", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5052, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (poison), Skill Focus (Perception), Skill Focus (Stealth), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+10 racial bonus on Stealth checks in areas of dim or no light.", "AC": "18, touch 10, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Shadow Hunter", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +15, Perception +12, Stealth +4 (+14 in dimly lit & unlit areas), Swim +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "hunt by scent", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +8, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +14 (1d8+10 plus poison plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
