While its typical diet consists of sea turtles, dugongs, and other aquatic prey, the sea scourge will feed on whatever creatures it can manage to get a hold of, and is known to prey on humanoids both in shallow waters and at sea, even going so far as to board seagoing vessels. A sea scourge's acid is capable of dissolving wood in addition to flesh and bone, making it a particularly dangerous threat to most boats. Though it can swim beneath the waves indefinitely, a sea scourge more often tends to search the surface of the ocean for prey, camouf laged as a large clump of ambergris or other seaborne excretion. <br><b>Variant Sea Scourges</b><br> Most sea scourges are encountered off the western coast of Garund in the Arcadian Ocean, but some breeds have been known to stalk other parts of the high seas. <br><b>Coldwater Scourge (+0 CR):</b> Stalking the watery expanses of the northern Arcadian Ocean and Inner Sea, the coldwater scourge is a menace to merchant ships and war galleons alike. A coldwater scourge is immune to cold damage, and creatures that fail their Ref lex saves versus the scourge's acid jet are also staggered for 1 round. <br><b>Steaming Scourge (+1 CR):</b> The steaming scourge plagues the open waters of the Obari Ocean, sapping the life from unsuspecting marine animals as well as unwary fisherfolk and small seaside settlements. A steaming scourge possesses additional Hit Dice and the heat universal monster ability, and emits so much energy that any water in a 10-foot-radius spread around it begins to boil, dealing 1d6 points of damage to creatures that begin their turn submerged in it.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Isles Of The Shackles", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, swarm (2-5), or bloom (6-9)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(9d8+36)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 7, Con 18, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2746, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "7, touch 7, flat-footed 7", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Sea Scourge", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +15, Swim +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-2", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm oceans", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +1, Will -2", "Melee": "2 slams +12 (1d6+7 plus 1d4 acid and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., climb 10 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
