A turtle-shark surprises many foes with its quickness in the water. Many assume that it is as slow as its other shelled kin, and underestimate its shark-like speed. Like its predatory cousins, a turtle-shark attacks nearly anything it can reach, especially if there is blood or activity in the water.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Stygian Turtle-shark</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 12</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>19,200</h5><h5>NE Gargantuan magical beast (aquatic, extraplanar)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+3; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +17</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>26, touch 9, flat-footed 23 (+3 Dex, +17 natural, -4 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>175 (14d10+98)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+16, <b>Ref </b>+12, <b>Will </b>+6</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>shell; <b>DR </b>10/magic; <b>Resist </b>cold 10, fire 10; <b>SR </b>23</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>10 ft., swim 40 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +23 (4d8+12/19-20 plus grab), slam +22 (2d6+12)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>20 ft.; <b>Reach </b>15 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>capsize, smite good, swallow whole (2d6+12 plus 2d6 acid damage, AC 18, 17 hp)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>34, <b>Dex </b>16, <b>Con </b>25, <b>Int </b> 3, <b>Wis </b>10, <b>Cha </b>8</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+14; <b>CMB </b>+30 (+34 grapple); <b>CMD </b>43</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Critical (bite), Iron Will, Power Attack, Swim-by Attack, Weapon Focus (bite)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Perception +17, Swim +20</h5><h5><b>SQ </b>amphibious</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> River Styx</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>incidental</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>This fiendish monster is likely to be encountered when adventurers are crossing or journeying near the River Styx as it winds through the underworld.
