Twice per day as a standard action, it can billow forth a cloud of dust that surrounds it in a 10-foot radius. Creatures caught within the area must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 6 rounds. The dust cloud remains for 2 rounds and can be affected by wind. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Skulletons are undead creatures believed to have been created by a lich or demilich, for the creature greatly resembles the latter in that it is nothing more than a pile of dust, a skull, and a collection of bones.</p><p>The gemstones inset in its eye sockets and in place of its teeth are not gemstones at all, but painted glass (worthless). The skulleton is thought to have been created to frighten off would-be tomb plunderers, or convince them they have defeated the skulleton's creator rather than a minor servitor and tomb guardian.</p><p>A skulleton lies in wait for its prey. When a living creature touches a skulleton, it uses its dust attack to incapacitate and confuse the intruders.</p><p>Then it rises in the air, pivoting to face its prey and glowering in a display of fearsome presence, using its Dazzling Display feat as a full-round action to attempt to demoralize those near it. If the intruders have not fled, it moves in to bite with its gem-encrusted teeth.</p><p><br><b>Construction</b><br> A skulleton's body consists of a humanoid skull and the bones and dusty remains of its body. The false jewels are worthless, but do require a jeweler of some skill to properly cut and mount them to lend them an air of authenticity. Additional rare powders and incense worth 3,500 gp are also needed to complete the process.</p><p>SKULLETON <br><b>CL</b> 9th; <b>Price</b> 8,000 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b><i>animate dead</i>, <i>contagion</i>, <i>fly</i>, <i>stinking cloud</i>, creator must be caster level 9th; <b>Skill</b> Craft (jeweler) DC 15; <b>Cost</b> 4,000 gp Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 6, Dex 10, Con -, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3014, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dazzling Display, Weapon FinesseB, Skill Focus (Intimidate)B, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 12, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Skulleton", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +19, Intimidate +12, Perception +11, Stealth +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +1, Will +5", "Melee": "bite +5 (1d3-2 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 10 ft.
