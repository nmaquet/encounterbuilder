Creatures that are sexually attracted to females who view this dance suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected again by the same baobhan sith's captivating dance for one day. A captivated creature is dazed (it cannot attack, but can defend normally). This continues for as long as the baobhan sith dances. A baobhan sith can move and act normally (including using her spelllike abilities) while maintaining her dance. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5><h5><b> Dying Words (Sp)</b> When a baobhan sith is slain, she utters a curse as a free action (whether it's her turn or not) that affects her killer as if it were a <i>bestow curse</i> spell (caster level 10th). The target can resist the curse with a successful DC 19 Will save. If the save fails, the target suffers a -6 decrease to its highest ability score. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Baobhan sith (bavaan shee) are evil female fey that feed on the blood of living creatures. By entrancing creatures with their dance, they lure men to their deaths. Baobhan sith are always female; no males of this race are known to exist.</p><p>These creatures are generally found in remote locations such as unclaimed forests or overgrown and ruined keeps, castles, or the like; always a secluded location, but close enough to a populated area that the baobhan sith can feed when hungry. Their lairs are typically clean; the monsters have disposed of the rotting corpses of past victims. They are solitary creatures and never work in groups. Baobhan siths each have their own hunting ground and to intrude on another's is certain death.</p><p>Baobhan siths prefer to use their abilities against male humanoids, particularly elves or humans. They generally avoid dwarves and halflings, though if food is scarce they have no qualms about draining the blood of just about any living creature. They do not drink the blood of animals; no matter how hungry they are, as they see this as primitive and savage.</p><p>A baobhan sith stands 5 to 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs roughly 120 pounds. Her hair ranges in color from black or brown to golden yellow.</p><p>Eye color varies but is usually brown or green. A baobhan sith wears flowing, loose-fitting robes or tunics of white often tied at the waist with a scarf of red or black.</p><p>A baobhan sith prefers to attack a lone target and generally avoids combat with groups, fleeing if confronted by such a party. Stragglers are often the subject of the baobhan sith's attention if the straggler is far enough behind its comrades.</p><p>When first encountered, a baobhan sith opens combat with her captivating dance. Creatures that fail to succumb are <i>entangle</i>d. Once she has captivated at least one foe, she moves in and sinks her teeth into its chest or throat and drains blood. If overwhelmed or outnumbered, the baobhan sith uses her <i>entangle</i> ability (if she hasn't already used it) and tries to slip away into the surrounding forest.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Common, Elven, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d6+36)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 19, Con 18, Int 16, Wis 16, Cha 19", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2245, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Mobility", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 15, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Baobhan Sith", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +16, Bluff +16, Craft (any one) +15, Escape Artist +16, Knowledge (nature) +15, Perception +17, Perform (dance) +16, Sense Motive +17, Stealth +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any forest", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +10, Will +9", "Melee": "2 claws +7 (1d6+3), bite +7 (1d6+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
