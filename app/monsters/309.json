Because some of the stronger elemental fire races enslave salamanders for their metalworking skill and fighting prowess, the salamanders hate the efreet and other inhabitants with a passion.</p><p>Though their lairs typically hover in temperatures of 500 degrees F or more, salamanders can tolerate lower temperatures. They generally do so only when forced, and are even surlier and more short-tempered than normal in such environments. Although they hail from the Plane of Fire, the salamander race identifies more with the Abyss, and they hold demons (particularly those associated with fire, like balors and certain fire-themed demon lords) in great esteem. It's not unusual to encounter large groups of salamanders in the Abyss as a result.</p><p>Salamanders are often conjured to the Material Plane to serve as guardians or, more commonly, to craft weapons, armor, and other metalwork, for their skill in these areas is legendary. Salamanders also infest areas of the Material Plane where the boundaries between this world and the Plane of Fire have worn thin, such as in and near volcanoes.</p><p>Because their habitat is so extreme, salamanders only save treasure that can withstand high temperatures, such as swords, armor, jewels, rods, and other items made from high-melting-point metals. Salamander society is a cruel one based on power and the ability to subjugate those beneath oneself. Beings beneath a salamander that cause it discomfort are dealt a slow and painful death.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Ignan", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or cluster (3-5)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 13, Con 18, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.
