Melee weapons do not endanger a user in this way. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a dragonfish. A creature that takes more than 2 points of damage from a dragonfish's barb has its speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts until the barb is removed, requiring a DC 15 Heal check at least 1 point of magical healing. A failure on the Heal check to remove a dragonfish spine results in 1d4 additional points of damage. </h5><h5><b>Dragonfish Poison (Ex)</b> Spine-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 11; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Constitution; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i> </h5><h5><b>Camouflage (Ex)</b> It takes a successful DC 20 Perception check to recognize a motionless dragonfish for what it really is.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A dragonfish is a small, 2-foot long, flat fish that makes its home on the bottom of shallow lakes, rivers, or streams. The dragonfish's back is covered with long, sharp spines. A dragonfish's dorsal spines carry a virulent poison that is delivered whenever an opponent contacts a spine. They are non-aggressive and spend their days eating miniscule water creatures, insects, and aquatic plants.</p><p>Dragonfish are not aggressive and prefer to lie on the bottom of a body of water, waiting for a victim to step on it so its poisonous spines penetrate the victim's flesh. If forced into melee, a dragonfish attacks with its bite.</p><p>Credit The Dragonfish originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Albie Fiore.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 15, Con 11, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 4", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3458, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "Dragonfish use their Dexterity modifier for Swim checks.", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Dragonfish", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +7, Stealth +10, Swim +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +5, Will +0", "Melee": "bite +2 (1d4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
