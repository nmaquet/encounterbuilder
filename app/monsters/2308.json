Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same churr's howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Churrs are savage ape-like creatures found in heavily forested areas.</p><p>They are fairly intelligent, standing 8 feet tall and have great reach. Some churrs are known to use primitive clubs or fashion spears with which to hunt. Churrs are omnivorous, eating fresh game as well as fruits and vegetable matter.</p><p>In rare instances, stone-aged tribes have been known to adopt churr as guardians, teaching them sign language and a few words, which they can repeat with a guttural accent that takes some time and practice to understand. Churr may cross breed with most humanoid and ape species making them a \"missing link\" or bridge species. Their progeny are often somewhat smaller but more intelligent, having full linguistic capacity.</p><p>Evil bands of churr are known to kidnap humanoids to use as slaves for collecting fruit and de-lousing purposes. Such slaves are kept until such time as they have enraged the churr and it decides to eat it.</p><p>A churr stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Churrs speak a bastardized form of Giant.</p><p>Churr begin combat by unleashing their horrific howl and beating their chests. They then charge opponents attempting to get their meaty paws around them and choke the life from them.<b></p><p>Churr Society</b></p><p> Churrs tend to congregate in small bands or packs of less than 20 individuals. Males dominate the pack and females are tasked with menial chores, childbearing, and the raising of the young. Usually the strongest and most powerful churr becomes the leader. Fights to the death are not uncommon when the current leader dies as the replacements vie for the open slot.<br><b>Churr Characters</b><br> Churr have racial Hit Dice and can have class level.
