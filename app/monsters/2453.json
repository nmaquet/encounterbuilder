When not fighting the abyssal wars among the demon princes, shrroths are often sent to the Material Plane to tempt and corrupt mortals with promises of power and wealth. Those refusing such offers are captured by the shrroth and brought to its Abyssal layer. They are confined in a stone cage and thrown into the Abyssal sea where they sink to the bottom and are never seen again.</p><p>Shrroths are malevolent creatures and though they follow the orders of their superiors, they are difficult to control. Fights amongst groups, packs, or battalions is not uncommon when there demons are involved, and such fights always end with the deaths of several of their number.</p><p>A shrroth is a 15-foot tall copper-colored demon with the lower torso of an octopus and the upper torso of a powerful humanoid. Its arms end in 6-fingered talons. Its lower torso sports a mass of writing tentacles reaching lengths of 10 feet. Six larger tentacles stretching 20 feet surround the smaller tentacles. The shrroth's visage is one of hatred and despair. Its mouth is filled with serrated teeth and its eyes are violet. A mass of long black hair hangs from its head; from under which protrude two forward-curving, blackish horns.</p><p>Shrroths rarely confront creatures on land; they prefer to fight in the Abyssal waters of their native plane where they have the advantage.</p><p>These demons open combat using <i>chaos hammer</i> to batter their foes.</p><p>This is quickly followed by <i>feeblemind</i> against an arcane caster if one is present. If a shrroth grabs an opponent in its tentacles, it hangs on, constricts it and stabs it with its trident. When facing an air-breathing creature, the shrroth likes to cast <i>water breathing</i> on it, grab it, and swim as deep as it can in the water before dispelling the <i>water breathing</i> effect and watching the air-breather drown.</p><p>If in danger, or if facing powerful adversaries, the shrroth summons a horde of melethzus (see summon above) to aid it in battle or to cover its retreat.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, plus one more; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+96)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 10, Con 27, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2453, "SubType": "(aquatic, chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Cleave, Deceitful, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "16", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "23, touch 12, flat-footed 23", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Shrroth Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +23, Diplomacy +19, Disguise +6, Intimidate +19, Knowledge (planes) +17, Perception +26, Sense Motive +18, Stealth +7, Swim +32", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious, jet", "Saves": "Fort +16, Ref +10, Will +7", "Melee": "trident +19/+12/+9 (3d6+9) or 2 claws +19 (1d6+9), bite +19 (1d8+9), 6 tentacles +14 (2d6+4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Huge"}
