Regardless of the color or size, metallic oozes resemble large piles of coins. The oozes use their appearance to lure wouldbe treasure hunters to their doom. Because of this, they are sometimes referred to as hoard oozes. Its form is coarse and rough giving it the appearance of piles of coins. A metallic ooze can flatten its body in order to squeeze through spaces and cracks where it normally could not go.</p><p>A metallic ooze can be found virtually anywhere, though it tends to inhabit dungeons, ruined temples, castles, and other buildings where treasure seekers seem to enjoy perfecting their craft. From a distance of 30 feet or more, a metallic ooze resembles a pile of loose coins (of whatever type its coloration most closely resembles). A creature can attempt a DC 20 Perception check to notice the ooze for what it is. This monster does not collect treasure, but the remnants of living creatures that meet their demise at the hands of this creature are often found scattered about its lair.</p><p>A metallic ooze lies still until it detects a potential meal within range. It then forms a pseudopod and pummels the opponent. Creatures killed by a metallic ooze are devoured. While a metallic ooze can cling to walls and ceilings (and often does drop on unsuspecting prey), it prefers to wander dungeon corridors and such on the ground, often waiting in one spot until living prey wanders too close.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "-3", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(7d8+56)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 1, Con 26, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2917, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "Hoard Ooze", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "4, touch 4, flat-footed 4", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Metallic Ooze", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-3", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref -3, Will -3", "Melee": "slam +7 (1d8+4 plus 1d6 acid plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., climb 10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
