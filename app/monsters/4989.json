An attached burrowing lamprey is effectively grappling its prey. The burrowing lamprey loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity. A burrowing lamprey has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached burrowing lamprey can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the burrowing lamprey is removed. </h5><h5><b>Flesh Burrow (Ex)</b> At the start of its next turn, the round after it attaches to its prey, a burrowing lamprey burrows into the target's flesh and subjects it to its poison. Applying flame to the point of entry deals 1d6 points of fire damage to both the host and the burrowing lamprey. Cutting the lamprey out works, but the longer the lamprey remains in the host, the more damage this method does. Cutting a lamprey out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 20 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage to the host per round the lamprey has been inside it. If the Heal check succeeds, one lamprey is removed. <i>Remove disease</i> instantly kills any burrowing lampreys inside a host. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Flesh burrow-injury; <i>save</i> DC 14 Fort; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Constitution damage; <i>cure</i> -. The save DC is Constitution-based. The lamprey's poison liquefies the host's organs. A successful saving throw can prevent Con damage for that round, but the only cure is to remove the burrowing lamprey from the host.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The burrowing lamprey is an eel-like fish that attaches to its prey, and then burrows into its body, feasting on blood and the rich vital organs. They are a danger to fish and aquatic mammals, and can be as deadly as a school of piranha when encountered in large numbers. Burrowing lampreys resemble eels three to four feet long, with sphincter-like mouths positioned within hardened cartilaginous beaks. Although they are usually marine creatures, burrowing lampreys breed in coastal freshwater swamps and rivers, and thus can be found in both fresh and saltwater environments. They prefer to either ambush prey by hiding along the ocean floor or in rocky crevices, or swarm around a target if traveling in numbers. However, it is possible that they can be encountered inside a dead creature's remains, feeding on its vital organs. Medium- and large-sized burrowing lampreys are less common, but sometimes found in the deeper sea, where they may attack large sharks or even small whales. Burrowing lampreys seek out targets at least equal to their size category, and up to three sizes larger, if they can, though a starving lamprey attacks just about anything. They attack with their bite, then immediately attempt to burrow into their victim.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "cluster (2-5) or swarm (6-20)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4989, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Weapon FinesseB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Escape Artist", "AC": "15, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Burrowing Lamprey", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Escape Artist +10, Perception +5, Swim +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +1", "Melee": "bite +4 (1d4 plus attach plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
