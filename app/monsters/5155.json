Most don't know of their monstrous origins, but there comes a time in every changeling's life when these roots begin to call out to their host, urging the confused girl toward some end she can't identify. When a hag of any sort conceives a child with a man, the result is a changeling. The male parent is usually killed and eaten by his partner before he can see the offspring. Changelings are, without exception, female, and almost always tall and slender. A changeling's hair is typically long and dark, and her skin abnormally pale, but she otherwise looks for all practical purposes like a member of her father's race. A frequent-but not universal-trait of changelings is noticeably mismatched eyes, each of which is a different color common among her father's race. Upon reaching puberty and adulthood, the average changeling born to a human father stands approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 110 pounds. <br><b>CHANGELING CHARACTERS</b><br> Changelings are defined by their class levels- they don't have racial Hit Dice. All changelings have the following racial traits. <br><b>-2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma:</b> Changelings are frail, but are clever and comely. <br><b>Hag Trait:</b> A changeling possesses one of the following traits, depending on the type of hag her mother is. <br><i>Hulking Changeling (Annis Hag)</i>: The changeling gains a +1 racial bonus on melee damage rolls. <br><i>Green Widow (Green Hag)</i>: The changeling gains a +2 racial bonus on Bluff checks against creatures that are sexually attracted to her. <br><i>Sea Lungs (Sea Hag)</i>: The changeling can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to 3 x her Constitution score before she risks drowning. <br><b>Claws:</b> A changeling's hands and fingernails tend to harden and become sharp, granting her two claw attacks, each of which deals 1d4 points of damage. <br><b>Natural Armor:</b> Changelings have a +1 natural armor bonus. <br><b>Darkvision:</b> Changelings can see in the dark up to 60 feet. <br><b>Languages: </b>Changelings begin play speaking Common and the primary language of their host society. Changelings who have high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Orc.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic, Elven, Orc", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "-1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d6+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 8, Con 12, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5155, "SubType": "(changeling)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Brew Potion, Combat Casting", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "witchAPG 1", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "10, touch 9, flat-footed 10", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Changeling", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Craft (alchemy) +10, Heal +6, Knowledge (arcana) +6, Spellcraft +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "Female changeling", "CR": "1/2", "XP": 200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "1", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "hulking changeling, witch's familiar (spider)", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref -1, Will +4", "Melee": "2 claws +0 (1d4+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "LN", "Size": "Medium"}
