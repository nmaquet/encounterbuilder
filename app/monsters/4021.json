All of them, on rare occasions, produce giant varieties. Opportunistic carnivores, weasels prefer their food live, or at least fresh. To maintain their high metabolism they must consume close to 40% of their body weight per day, so giant weasels hunt a wide variety of creatures. Though generally fearful of sentient creatures, giant weasels aggressively protect their territory. Weasels fight by attaching themselves to their foes with their sharp incisors and then ripping open their victims' flesh with teeth and claws. Using this tactic, giant weasels can take down large animals, such as elk and moose, and attack other predators if they can take them by surprise. Weasels can be found in almost any climate, from jungles to the arctic. Exceptional climbers, they are equally at ease moving overland or scrambling up rocky cliffs, and can even swim if necessary. Giant weasels make their homes in abandoned dens and burrows, and often bring back fur from their prey to line nests. Most weasels mate in the spring and give birth to litters of four to 10 young in the early summer. Giant weasels' coats range from red to brown and sometimes gray; their underbellies are usually a lighter color, often white. They also exhibit a wide variety of markings ranging from stripes to masks, and some molt during the winter, producing a pure white coat. The proportion of the head and jaw varies among various subspecies. During mating season and when frightened, weasels release a pungent musk. Though it's offensive to most creatures, it's not debilitating like a skunk's musk. In folk tales and among hunters and trappers, weasels have a reputation for being exceptionally clever. Elders warn of giant weasels making off with human children, just as small weasels steal the eggs of birds. Giant weasels grow to up to 9 feet in length from nose to the base of their tails, which can grow to almost the length of their bodies. They weigh upward of 300 pounds. <br><b>Giant Weasel Companions</b><br> <b>Starting Statistics</b>: <b>Size</b> Medium; <b>Speed</b> 40 ft.; <b>AC</b> +1 natural armor; <b>Attack</b> bite (1d6), 2 claws (1d4); <b>Ability Scores</b> Str 13, Dex 19, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 11; <b>Special Qualities</b> low-light vision, scent <b>7th-Level Advancement</b>: <b>Size</b> Large; <b>AC</b> +2 natural armor; <b>Attack</b> bite (1d8), 2 claws (1d6); <b>Ability Scores</b> Str +8, Dex -2, Con +4; <b>Special <b>Attack</b>s</b> attach</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "AP 67", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(4d8+16)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4021, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Stealthy", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "1", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Survival when tracking by scent", "AC": "15, touch 12, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Giant Weasel", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +16, Escape Artist +5, Perception +8, Stealth +5, Survival +2 (+6 when tracking by scent)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +7, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +6 (1d8+4 plus attach and bleed), 2 claws +6 (1d6+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., climb 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
