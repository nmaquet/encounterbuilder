A ghost-faced orc invisible in shadows can still be detected by hearing and smell. A <i>true seeing</i> spell (or other similar magic) reveals its location as well.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>When they may be seen at all, ghost-faced orcs appear as normal orcs who paint their faces in grotesque skull like patterns. Invisible in shadow and darkness to all but one another due to unholy pacts with their dark god, their face paint gives them the impression of floating disembodied skulls.</p><p>Ghost-faced orcs are similar in every way to their common cousins- filthy, smelly, aggressive and thoroughly cruel. Their hair is ranges from black to slate grey to shock white. Their equipment is ill kempt and crudely made, leaving most to forage for better gear amongst their victims. Ghostfaces are seldom seen above ground except on moonless nights.</p><p>Ghost-faced orcs are proficient with all simple weapons. Most are warriors, fighters or barbarians and favor greataxes and longspears to any other weapon. They on occasion carry shortbows for hunting or ambushes.</p><p>Ghost-Faced Orc Society Ghost-faced orcs differ little from their kin with the exception that a larger portion of their population are clerics in service of Grotaag. As such these battle priests hold a revered place in society. The priesthood is referred to as the Ghost Face Cabal which is made up of the highest level clerics amongst the tribe. The cabals outfit themselves and their most powerful slayers with enchanted weapons, armor and potions.<br><b>Ghost-Faced Orc Characters</b><br> Ghost-faced Orc leaders tend to be clerics of Grotaag or powerful barbarian champions.
