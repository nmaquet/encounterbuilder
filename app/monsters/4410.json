Creatures within 10 feet of a sprite swarm with line of sight must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is dazzled for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Concentrated Rush (Ex)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, if more than one creature occupies a sprite swarm's space, the swarm may use its attack action to concentrate on one of these creatures to deal 4d6 points of damage in place of its normal swarm damage. Other creatures within the horde's space do not take swarm damage that round. </h5><h5><b>Mob Mentality (Ex)</b> As long as a sprite swarm has at least 10 hit points, it retains its Intelligence score and can act accordingly. Even so, it cannot be targeted by mind-affecting spells or effects that target a single creature. If its hit points fall below 10, the swarm is considered mindless as the individual creatures within begin to panic.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>When intruders threaten their beloved homes, sprite guards in large villages are taught to call for their fellow tribe members to form a vicious, enveloping swarm to drive back their enemies. Typically consisting of at least 5,000 sprites, these swarms are known for inf licting pain upon any creatures in their paths. Sprite swarms typically form only when the sprites' village is threatened by a large number of intruders or a single powerful foe; however, the malevolent sprites of Geb are quick to form swarms when faced with intrusion of any kind.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "Fey Revisited", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d6+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 3, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4410, "SubType": "(swarm)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Dodge, Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 18, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sprite Swarm", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +30, Intimidate +10, Perception +14, Sense Motive +9, Stealth +28", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "mob mentality", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +10, Will +7", "Melee": "swarm (2d6 plus distraction)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "15 ft., fly 60 ft.
