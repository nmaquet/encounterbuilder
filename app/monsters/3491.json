The average giant seahorse is about eight feet long and weighs 300 pounds.</p><p>Giant seahorses eat a variety of aquatic life, including plants, shrimp, and other small aquatic life. They are slow swimmers and never pursue their prey.</p><p>Giant seahorses reproduce through internal fertilization and do so four times each year (once per season). During reproduction, the female giant seahorse lays between 300 and 700 eggs in the male's incubation pouch (which resembles the pouch of a kangaroo). After 20 days, the eggs hatch, and the young remain in the pouch until they are capable of swimming on their own (about ten days). Newborn giant seahorses are about 1-foot long and reach maturity in 8 months. About 30% of all young seahorses die before birth (either the eggs don't hatch or the young die before emerging from the pouch). Giant seahorses are monogamous and mate for life.</p><p>A giant seahorse is about 8 feet long from the top of its head to the tip of its tail. Its body is covered in fine scales and its head is horse-like with a long snout. Its back is lined with small dorsal fins. (These aid it in swimming.) Near the base of its head are pectoral fins that help the giant seahorse turn while swimming. A giant seahorse ranges in color from yellow to dull green or brown. Its eyes are almost always brown with the occasion giant seahorse having blue eyes.</p><p>Giant seahorses are not aggressive creatures and only attack if cornered or if a member of the herd is threatened. In combat, a giant seahorse butts an opponent with its bony head. Most however simply flee when confronted.<br><b>Training a Giant Seahorse</b><br> A giant seahorse requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.</p><p>To be trained, a giant seahorse must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check).</p><p>Training a seahorse as an aquatic mount requires six weeks of work and a successful Handle Animal check (DC 25). Riding a seahorse requires an exotic saddle. A seahorse can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds at a Ride check.</p><p>Seahorse eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant seahorse.<br><b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a giant seahorse is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds. A giant seahorse can drag 4,500 pounds.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary, pair or herd (20-40)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3491, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": ", +4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "16, touch 12, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Giant Seahorse", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +13, Stealth +7, Swim +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "slam +6 (1d6+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
