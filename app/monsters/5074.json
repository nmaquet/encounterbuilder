In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell <i>slow</i>s a stone idol (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while <i>transmute mud to rock</i> heals all of its lost hit points. A <i>stone to flesh</i> spell does not actually change the stone idol's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round. A <i>disintegrate</i> spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol. A <i>chaos hammer</i>, <i>holy smite</i>, <i>order's wrath</i>, or <i>unholy blight</i> spell deals 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells. </h5><h5><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in 1d4+2 days. </h5><h5><b>Site Bound (Ex)</b> A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it is brought back into the area. </h5><h5><b>Roar (Su)</b> A sphinx stone idol can roar up to three times per day as a standard action. Affected creatures become frightened for 2d6 rounds. A DC 17 Will save negates the effect. The roar is a mind-affecting <i>fear</i> effect and a sonic effect that fills a 100-foot-radius burst, centered on the stone idol sphinx. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same sphinx stone idol's roar for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A stone idol sphinx is about 15 feet long and weighs around 29,000 pounds. A sphinx stone idol often has the head of an animal considered sacred by the religion: jackal-headed, goat-headed, vulture-headed, and so on. A stone idol sphinx attacks first using its roar and then using its vicious bite and slashing with its stony paws. It often takes to the air where it can gain an advantage on its foes. <br><b>Construction</b><br> A stone idol sphinx is chiseled from a block of smooth stone that weighs at least 6,000 pounds. It must be of exceptional quality and have a value of not less than 10,000 gp.
