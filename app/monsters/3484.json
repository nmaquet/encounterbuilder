Giant pikes are highly adaptable and can be found in the coldest to the warmest waters. A saltwater variety exists and can be found in inland seas and saltwater lakes and rivers.</p><p>Giant pikes, like their smaller counterparts, are voracious and often attack prey much larger than themselves. Their diet consists mainly of soft-finned fish, trout, perch, frogs, mice, ducks, birds, and small humanoids. Larger prey includes humanoids, other giant fish, deer, and sheep or goats. Giant pikes have no qualms about eating those of their own kind, especially when food is scarce.</p><p>The giant pike averages about nine feet long and can grow to a length of 20 feet. Its coloration varies from dark green to brown and its body is covered in lighter colored spots. It has a single dorsal fin and a white or cream-colored underbelly.</p><p>The giant pike hides in weeds, behind rocks, or some other such cover, waiting for potential prey to wander nearby. It coils its body into an \"S\" position, and when prey passes by, strikes with blinding speed, biting with its sharp teeth. If the pike gets a hold on prey smaller than itself, it swallows it.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or school (2-4)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 18, Con 15, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3484, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception.
