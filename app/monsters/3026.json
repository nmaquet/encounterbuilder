A successful ranged touch attack is required to hit. If struck, a target takes 4d8 points of acid damage.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Giant slugs are found in moist or wet environments such as swamps, marshes, rain forests, and dungeons. They are both scavengers and predators feeding on both plants and animals. Giant slugs are nocturnal creatures and spend the daylight hours away from the heat of the sun.</p><p>On extremely hot days, giant slugs bury themselves in debris where they secrete a thick coating of mucus that covers their entire body and protects them from the heat.</p><p>Giant slugs are larger versions of normal slugs. They are pale gray in color with a dull white underbelly. They have a single pair of long, thin tentacles or antennae. The giant slug uses them to sense brightness, heat, and to smell.</p><p>A giant slug begins combat by spitting a line of corrosive saliva at an opponent. It then moves into combat and uses its bite attack.</p><p>A typical giant slug is 20 feet long but can grow to twice that length.</p><p>Credit The Giant Slug originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d8+48)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 27, Dex 10, Con 18, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "spit +7 touch (4d8 acid)", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3026, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 8, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Giant Slug", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm marshes and underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "malleable", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +4, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +15 (2d6+12) 1d8 acid)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., burrow 10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
