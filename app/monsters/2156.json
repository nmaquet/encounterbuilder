In this form, it appears as a solid black shadow of its true form. It gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal defensive ability while in void form. Any gear or armor the yai carries becomes incorporeal as well-it loses its AC bonus from armor and natural armor, but gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier (+7 for most void yai, for an AC of 16). It may still speak while incorporeal and can still use its spell-like and special abilities. </h5><h5><b>Void Missile (Su)</b> As a swift action, a void yai can launch a bolt of darkness from its third eye. Damage caused by this missile is negative energy damage. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. </h5><h5><b>Void Trap (Su)</b> When a void oni uses any teleportation effect on itself (including its <i>greater teleport</i> and <i>plane shift</i> spell-like abilities, but not its <i>teleport object</i> spell-like ability), it can choose to arrive at its destination in void form as a free action. When it does so, it leaves behind a temporary lesser <i>sphere of annihilation</i> in a square of its choice that was part of its space before it teleported. This <i>sphere of annihilation</i> cannot be caused to move by other creatures, but the sphere itself moves at a <i>fly</i> speed of 30 feet (perfect) toward the closest Tiny or larger creature on the oni's next turn. If no appropriate creature is within 30 feet, the sphere does not move that round. If the sphere enters a square occupied by a creature (or if a creature touches the sphere), that creature is affected as if by a <i>disintegrate</i> spell (CL 20th, DC 23). Once the sphere damages a creature with this effect, the sphere vanishes-it also vanishes on its own after 24 hours in the unlikely event that it never discharges on a creature. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The concept of the void is a difficult one for many individuals to grasp, for it encompasses more than just an absence of anything. The concept of \"void\" as an element also represents the heavens above, the dark places between the stars, the nature of the spiritual world, and even the capacity to create and en<i>vision</i> new ideas. The void yai represents all of these possibilities, interpreted in a way that exemplifies the evil of the oni race. Unlike lesser oni, the void yai does not represent any single humanoid race-the closest it comes is perhaps the rune giant, and certainly the void yai superficially resembles monsters of legend, with its dark, heavily muscled body, horns, and fangs. A void yai manifests when the combination of an extremely powerful oni spirt and an overwhelmingly evil location intersect at precisely the right time. Rarely, an eldritch transformation spontaneously elevates an existing yai to the vaunted status of void yai-whispers of vile rituals that an oni can perform to quicken this transformation keep some sages awake at night, for if such rituals existed, then all oni could potentially become void yai-a sobering thought indeed, given the void yai's daunting capacity for cruelty. As with almost all oni, the void oni's use of weapons and armor seems like cruel overkill. A void oni is 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds. Void yai turn toward the Material Plane to satisfy their desires, lording over lesser creatures with the aid of the void. A void yai usually claims a huge territory, bringing much larger creatures to heel as servants. As with fire yai, a void yai makes frequent use of lesser oni as its minions, but prefers to surround itself with whatever giant tribe or society it has conquered. Rarely, a void yai commands kingdoms of smaller humanoids, but since the immense void yai has no ability to assume the shape of such small and insignificant creatures, it often feels awkward and out of place. More so than other yai, void yai are ashamed of their true appearance-their vanity is such that most are masters of using their change shape ability to appear as breathtakingly handsome or beautiful giants, and it is in this form they prefer to live. Only when combat begins does their rage take control, causing them to revert to their true, horrific shapes. </br><b>VOIDLORDS</b></br> Between the considerable power of the typical void yai and the divine might of the oni daimyos exists a middling category of unique void yai. But to even use the term \"middling\" in this context is something of a folly, for these unique void yai, known collectively as the voidlords, are among the most powerful creatures to walk the Material Plane. While void yai typically content themselves with ruling nations, voidlords arrive with a greater mission-to control entire worlds and bring all that dwell upon these worlds to their knees. Voidlords are always void yai with additional racial Hit Dice or class levels-levels of fighter, monk, and rogue are favorite choices for voidlords. These powerful outsiders generally eschew spellcasting classes under the opinion that might and the oni's inborn supernatural abilities are a greater path to conquest than mortal magic. In addition to having the typical void yai abilities, each voidlord possesses an additional number of powers keyed to that voidlord's particular area of focus. Two sample voidlord foci are listed below, but these represent only a tiny fraction of the total possible. </br><b>Martial Arts:</b> A voidlord of martial arts always attacks with unarmed strikes-it is treated as a 20th-level monk with the flurry of blows ability for the purposes of determining its damage and number of attacks per round with its unarmed strikes. This voidlord gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, and gains the use of the following spell-like abilities three times per day: <i>forceful hand</i>, <i>grasping hand</i>, and <i>greater shout</i>. </br><b>Swordplay:</b> A voidlord of sword fighting always carries a sword of some sort-typically a katana. These voidlords gain the ability to use the following spell-like abilities three times per day: <i>blade barrier</i>, <i>keen edge</i>, and <i>mage's sword</i>. They are automatically proficient in the use of swords, and any sword they wield is treated as a <i>+5 weapon</i>, in addition to any other magical qualities the weapon might have. A voidlord of swordplay can also permanently transform any magic weapon (save for artifacts) into a sword of any size or type by touch.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Giant", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 3", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(23d10+253)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 44, Dex 15, Con 32, Int 18, Wis 23, Cha 25", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "void missile +23 touch (6d6 plus energy drain)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2156, "SubType": "(giant, native, oni, shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Critical Focus, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (greatclub), Improved Initiative, Improved Vital Strike, Iron Will, Power Attack, Staggering Critical, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "24", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "36, touch 9, flat-footed 35", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Void Yai", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +17 (+25 when jumping), Bluff +30, Fly +20, Intimidate +30, Knowledge (arcana) +27, Knowledge (history) +24, Knowledge (nobility) +14, Knowledge (planes) +27, Perception +29, Sense Motive +29, Spellcraft +24, Use Magic Device +30", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "21", "Race": "", "CR": "20", "XP": 307200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold or temperate mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "change shape (Large, Huge, or Gargantuan humanoid; giant form II), void form", "Saves": "Fort +24, Ref +9, Will +21", "Melee": "mwk greatclub +39/+34/+29/+24 (3d8+25/19-20) or 2 slams +23 (2d6+25)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 40 ft.
