This gives it a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks, and it cannot be flanked. </h5><h5><b>Superior Vision (Ex)</b> By magnifying an image, a giant chameleon can see five times as far as a normal human. This grants the chameleon a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks. This bonus stacks with all-around vision.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Giant chameleons are highly territorial creatures, and rarely is more than one is encountered in the same area, except during mating season when both a male and female may be encountered.</p><p>Giant chameleons are omnivorous, preferring to feed on giant insects such as flies, larva, crickets, grasshoppers, rodents, and lizards. They hunt during the daylight hours, spending the early morning hours sunning themselves on rocks or mounds of leaves and grass.</p><p>Giant chameleons reproduce up to three times per year. The female lays a clutch of 1d10+8 eggs and buries them in shallow earth or soil. Six months later, the young emerge into the world. Young giant chameleons reach maturity in a few months and leave the lair.</p><p>Giant chameleons are either green or brown in color with the females being slightly darker and heavier than the males. Males are distinguished by the white lateral line running the length of their bodies and the dark bands extending from head to tail. Females usually possess a dark yellow lateral stripe. Both species have striped throats and lips.</p><p>Giant chameleons sit completely still watching for potential prey to come within range of their tongue. Once a creature is located, the giant chameleon shoots its tongue out, grabs the prey, and reels it into its mouth, where it is chewed and swallowed.<br><b>Giant Horned Chameleon</b><br> The giant horned chameleon is a territorial creature and is rarely encountered with another of its kind except during mating season.</p><p>Giant horned chameleons are green or dark green. Males are distinguished by the three large horns protruding from their head. This grants them a gore attack (1d8 + Strength modifier) that they can use in lieu of a bite or tongue attack. Females possess the same horns, but they are usually underdeveloped (dealing 1d6 + Strength modifier). These chameleons have a crest on the back of their head, and bony ridges and spines running the length of their back.<br><b>Rock Chameleon Rock</b><br> chameleons resemble common giant chameleons but their natural coloration is gray and they are only found in warm and temperate mountains where their coloration allows them to blend in with their surroundings. They use the stats for the common giant chameleon, but only gain the bonus to Stealth checks in rocky surroundings.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Meghan Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(4d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "tongue +5 (1d3+3 plus grab)", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.
