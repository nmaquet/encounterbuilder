Though native to just about all of the Abyssal planes, they generally avoid those steeped in cold and ice (they have no particular vulnerability to cold; they just don't like it). Kytha are often employed by the Abyssal dukes and nobles as ground troops and soldiers in their battles against one another and against interlopers from other planes. The kytha's love of blood and battle greatly enhances their usefulness in the eyes of many of the Abyssal nobility. When not serving in the rank-and-file of some Abyssal noble's army, these monsters are found roaming the various Abyssal planes hunting and tracking down food, which to a kytha is just about anything it can catch and kill. It has a great fondness for the flesh of minor demons (dretch for example) and humans. Captured prey is usually devoured on the spot; rarely does a kytha kill something and save it for later. A kytha stands about 7 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds. Its skin is usually blue-black or solid black, and its eyes red. The fin-like spines running down its back are coal black. Upon entering combat, a kytha often frightens its opponents as it seemingly changes into a mindless killing machine; roaring and growling, drooling and hissing, as it circles its prey. A kytha attacks with its wickedly-sharp claws and with its envenomed tongue. Kytha enjoy combat, especially against creatures weaker than themselves, and so they never flee unless facing overwhelming odds. Many kytha however, equate fleeing with cowardice and choose to fight to the death, no matter the odds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Abyssal, Celestial, Celestial, Draconic, Draconic, telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+54 plus 9)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 16, Con 22, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4778, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Cleave, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, ToughnessB, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Intimidate, +8 Perception", "AC": "23, touch 13, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Kytha", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +15, Diplomacy +15, Intimidate +19, Knowledge (planes) +13, Perception +22, Sense Motive +14, Stealth +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +6, Will +8", "Melee": "2 claws +16 (1d6+7), bite +16 (1d8+10/19-20), tongue +16 (1d6+7 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
