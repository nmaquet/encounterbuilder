If successful, the target takes damage equal to the lords's Strength modifier and is moved back as normal. The balor lord does not need to move with the target if successful. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. </h5><h5><b>Scent (Ex)</b> The balor lord gains the scent ability while raging and can use this ability to locate unseen foes. </h5><h5><b>Death Throes (Su)</b> When killed, a balor lord explodes in a blinding flash of fire that deals 100 points of damage (half fire, half <i>unholy</i> damage) to anything within 100 feet. A Reflex save DC 35 halve the damage, this DC increases to 37 if the balor lord was killed in rage as the save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Entangle (Ex)</b> If a balor lord strikes a Medium or smaller foe with its whip, the balor can immediately attempt a grapple check without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the balor wins the check, it draws the foe into an adjacent square. The foe gains the grappled condition, but the balor does not. </h5><h5><b>Flaming Body (Su)</b> A balor lord's body is covered in dancing flames. Anyone striking a balor with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a balor or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists. </h5><h5><b>Lifedrinker (Su)</b> Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a heal spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per round. </h5><h5><b>Vorpal Strike</b> (Su)Any slashing weapon a balor lord wields (including its standard longsword and whip) gains the vorpal weapon quality. Weapons retain this quality for one hour after the balor releases the weapon, but after this the weapon reverts to its standard magical qualities, if any. </h5><h5><b>Whip Mastery (Ex)</b> A balor lord treats a whip as a light weapon for the purposes of two-weapon fighting, and can inflict lethal damage on a foe regardless of the foe's armor.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Even more terrible than the typical balor are those who do not call a demon lord their master, but instead are masters themselves. A balor lord typically rules over a region no larger than half the size of the realm in which it resides (as only full demon lords can command the rule of an entire Abyssal realm), and even though most balor lords rule much smaller regions (generally areas comparable in size to a single continent), their power is vast indeed.</p><p>A balor lord is typically a CR 21 to CR 25 monster (a range shared with the various unique nascent demon lords, with the range of CR 26 and above being the domain of the demon lords themselves), and as such serves quite well as the final villain in a long-running campaign. The majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger (although ranger balor lords never form bonds with animals), but some instead have levels of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard. Cleric balor lords are unknown, as they see themselves as objects of worship, not the other way around, although rumors persist of powerful balor clerics that directly serve demon lords or even evil gods.</p><p>In addition to any benefits a balor lord might gain from its class levels, all balor lords possess one additional unique ability over and above those granted by its race and class. Listed here are three sample balor lord abilities, but these samples are by no means the entirety of the strange powers a balor lord might wield.</p><p> </h5><h5><b>Lifedrinker (Su)</b> Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a heal spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per round.</p><p> </h5><h5><b>Master of Magic (Su) </b>The balor lord has additional spell-like abilities (20 spell levels' worth of 1st-4th level spells usable at will and 20 spell levels' worth of 5th-8th level spells usable 3 times a day).</p><p> </h5><h5><b>Soul Swallow (Su)</b> As a standard action, the balor lord can inhale the soul of a living creature within 30 feet. The target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 balor lord's racial HD + the balor lord's Charisma modifier) or die. The body of a humanoid creature killed in this manner immediately transforms into a demon under the balor lord's command (a babau, succubus, or shadow demon, according to the balor lord's whim).</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "d20pfsrd", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or warband (1 balor and 2-5 glabrezus)", "Ref": "17", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(20d10+5d12+375)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 43, Dex 23, Con 44, Int 24, Wis 26, Cha 29", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.
