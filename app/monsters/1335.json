These boots give the redcap a kick attack that it can make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full-attack action or as part of its movement just as if it had the Spring Attack feat. </h5><h5><b>Heavy Weapons (Ex)</b> A redcap can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty. </h5><h5><b>Irreligious (Ex)</b> Bitter and blasphemous, redcaps cannot stand the symbols of good-aligned religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a holy symbol, any redcap that can see the creature must make a DC 15 Will save or become frightened for 1 minute and attempt to flee. A redcap who successfully saves is shaken for 1 minute. </h5><h5><b>Red Cap (Su)</b> A redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a redcap gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls (included in the above totals) and fast healing 3. These benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. Caps are not transferable, even between redcaps. A redcap can create a new cap to replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of work, although until the redcap takes a standard action to dip the cap in the blood of a foe the redcap helped to kill, the cap does not grant its bonuses.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Redcaps embody both capriciousness and sadism. These stumpy, misanthropic fey freaks exist seemingly to indulge in blissful bloodletting and self-indulgent slaughter.</p><p>Like prune-faced, angry old men, they mollycoddle their own inefficiencies and miseries in gore. Redcaps are most widely recognized for their long woolen caps, which they drench in the blood of their victims. Rumors and fairy stories abound concerning rituals and the cultural significance of their blood-soaked caps, though the practice likely evolved as an easy way for the brutish runts to create both fear and spectacle. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with twisted frames, pointed ears, and long white beards. They dress in soiled leather armor and wear oversized, iron-shod boots that make a distinctive clanging when they run.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Common, Giant, Sylvan", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-12)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d6+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 19, Con 18, Int 16, Wis 13, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1335, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (scythe)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 15, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Redcap", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +15 (+27 jump), Bluff +13, Climb +15, Escape Artist +15, Intimidate +10, Knowledge (nature) +14, Perception +12, Sense Motive +12, Stealth +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests, mountains, or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "boot stomp, heavy weapons, red cap", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +10, Will +7", "Melee": "Medium scythe +10 (2d4+10/x4), kick +4 (1d4+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "60 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Small"}
