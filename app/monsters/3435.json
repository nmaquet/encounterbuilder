Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version. </h5><h5><b>Death Smoke (Ex)</b> A witherweed that takes at least 1 point of damage from a fire effect releases a cloud of deadly smoke that billows forth and quickly fills a 20-foot radius surrounding it. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. One minute later, another Fortitude save (same DC) must be made to avoid another 2d6 points of Constitution damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The cloud remains for 1 round per HD of the witherweed but a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Witherweeds resemble large patches of dry grass and weeds and are most often found in areas where their natural makeup allows them to blend in with their surroundings. A subterranean version of this monster exists and makes its lair in desolate caves and caverns.</p><p>Hidden among the creature's body are many long, sinewy strands that it uses to trap its foes. The average witherweed covers an area of 10 square feet, though specimens as large as 60 square feet have been encountered by a few dungeon delvers.</p><p>A witherweed attacks any living creature that comes within 10 feet of it, slashing and striking with its fronds. Slain creatures are devoured as the witherweed releases enzymes to break down its food and absorbs the nutrients.</p><p>A witherweed has one frond for each HD it possesses (thus, the typical 5 HD witherweed has 5 fronds while a 10 HD witherweed has 10 fronds).</p><p>Credit The Witherweed originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Simon Eaton.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+15)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 10, Con 16, Int -, Wis 13, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3435, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "13, touch 9, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Witherweed", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +1, Will +2", "Melee": "5 fronds +5 (1d4+3 plus 1d4 Dex)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "0 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
