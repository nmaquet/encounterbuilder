Though some believe the jyoti are inherently good because their home plane is the source of all life, these beliefs are quite in error, for the jyoti react to all other races with wary suspicion at best, and usually assume the worst and attack before they can themselves be attacked. They guard their crystalline cities from all intrusion, especially by creatures from other planes and servants of the gods. They have been known to hold dangerous artifacts in their vaults on behalf of desperate visitors, though in the case of holy or unholy artifacts, the jyoti are more likely to destroy the artifacts as soon as possible. Jyoti loathe natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane in particular, though there is an element of pity in their actions toward undead. They never discuss the sceaduinar, and even hearing that name inf lames jyoti into immediate anger. Those who dare argue on the sceaduinar's behalf are immediately attacked.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Auran, Common, Ignan, Terran", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or flight (3-8)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d10+44)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 20, Con 19, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "ray +16 ranged touch (by spell)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1270, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Casting, Dodge, Flyby Attack, Iron Will, Mobility, Wind Stance", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Knowledge (planes), +4 Knowledge (religion), +4 Perception", "AC": "24, touch 16, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Jyoti", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +9, Heal +16, Intimidate +16, Knowledge (planes) +19, Knowledge (religion) +19, Perception +20, Sense Motive +16, Stealth +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "11", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Positive Energy Plane)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +8, Will +11; +2 vs. divine", "Melee": "+1 ghost touch spear +14/+9/+4 (1d8+4/x3 plus 1d6 fire), bite +8 (1d6+1 plus 1d6 fire)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 90 ft.
