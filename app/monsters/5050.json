A DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or a DC 16 Heal check ends the ongoing acid damage. Multiple bites are cumulative. The save DC and check DC are both Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Lure (Ex)</b> A serpent creeper has a special air sac in its throat that it can turn inside out. By doing so, the air sac appears to be a piece of low-hanging fruit. A serpent creeper uses this ruse to draw its prey in closer. When a serpent creeper does this, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks beyond its normal racial bonus.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Serpent creepers are dangerous carnivorous plants that resemble 12-foot long pythons. When at rest, their green and brown coloration and the leafy patterns on their scales make them hard to distinguish from ordinary vines. Whether these creatures are naturally occurring or some weird magical cross of serpent and plant is unknown. Serpent creepers are typically 12-15 feet long. Their bodies are green and brown scales covered with various leaf-like patterns to aid them in their camouflage. Some serpent creepers can change the color of their scales slightly to better match their surroundings, adding to the ruse. Young serpent creepers are rarely encountered, but have been spotted. They appear as smaller versions of the adults, about 3 feet long. Reproduction and life cycles of serpent creepers are unknown. Serpent creepers are quintessential ambush hunters. When hunting, a serpent creeper hangs from a tree and puffs out its air sac, disguising it as a fruit indigenous to the local area. When prey moves in to examine or pluck the fruit, the serpent creeper springs to life and quickly coils around the target while biting it. Slain prey is dragged to a safe place and devoured over the course of several hours. An unfinished meal is left to forest scavengers. Serpent creepers have a particular like for the flesh of goblins and halflings.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or grove (2-6)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(6d8+18 plus 6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5050, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Power Attack, Stealthy, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+12 Disguise (as vine), +4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "18, touch 12, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Serpent Creeper", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +13, Disguise -2 (+10 as vine), Escape Artist +5, Perception +11, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "lure", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +5, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +8 (1d8+7 plus acidic poison and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
