This ability functions as the bard ability of the same name. </h5><h5><b>Harmonize (Sp)</b> When choral angels work together, they can use their complementary voices to create mystical harmonies. Two or more choral angels within 60 feet of one another can use <i>calm emotions</i> or <i>heroism</i> as a spell-like ability, four or more choral angels can use <i>shout</i>, and six or more choral angels can use greater <i>heroism</i> or <i>holy word</i>. Only the choral angel who actually uses the spell-like ability in question must take a standard action to achieve this effect-the other choral angels need only take swift actions during the same round. </h5><h5><b>Piercing Hymn (Su)</b> As a standard action, a choral angel can launch a concentrated blast of sonic energy from its mouth. This attack has a range of 90 feet with no range increment. Any creature struck by a choral angel's piercing hymn must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Choral angels are vocalists of unparalleled talent, and their singing fill the halls of good deities with soaring hymns and solemn chants. They manifest from the souls of the pious dead who possessed exceptional musical talent and pure spirits in life. Sometimes, mortals who did not possess musical talent but instead held a deep and abiding appreciation for the arts are gifted with this form upon ascending to the good-aligned planes after death. While choral angels are not soldiers and prefer to avoid combat, which many of their angelic brethren relish, these celestials can defend themselves with their puissant voices when need be, creating powerful magical effects that resonate with the purity in their hearts to overcome foes. Choral angels sometimes support astral devas in their duties by visiting the Material Plane bearing messages for mortals. These messages are inevitably good in nature, and it is a joyous event when a choral angel appears to a mortal. If the celestials expect danger or opposition during their visit, they travel in groups called ensembles, and use their harmonizing voices to spread the word of their patron as well as to bolster their allies in battle. If particularly vexed or pressed, an ensemble of choral angels can use their harmonies to devastating effect, obliterating their foes with powerful chants drawn from Elysium or hymns dedicated to the powers of Heaven. Most choral angels stand only 3-1/2 feet tall, and their svelte frames weigh a meager 40 pounds. Their hair is always of a metallic sheen resembling that of rare natural minerals and ores such as platinum, gold, and silver, though some of the oldest choral angels posses hair that glimmers perpetually like emeralds, sapphires, or diamonds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Draconic, Infernal; truespeech", "Source": "Chronicle Of The Righteous", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, duet, or ensemble (3-8)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 16, Con 15, Int 16, Wis 16, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "piercing hymn +12 (2d6 sonic plus deafen)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4413, "SubType": "(angel, extraplanar, good)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 14, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Choral Angel", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +14, Diplomacy +14, Escape Artist +11, Fly +20, Knowledge (planes) +14, Knowledge (religion) +14, Perception +16, Perform (sing) +14, Sense Motive +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any good-aligned plane", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +9, Will +9; +4 vs. poison, +4 resistance vs. evil", "Melee": "slam +10 (1d3+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
