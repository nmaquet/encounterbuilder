A gholdako's eyeball is sunken and milky, and its body and limbs are wrapped tightly in ragged strips of soiled linens much like a mummy, though disturbing and incomprehensible glyphs remain scribbled on the ancient cloth, written in what appears to be dried blood. Layers of skin continually flake off of the monster's parched, exposed flesh, which is a sickly, pale yellow. The average gholdako stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Gholdakos are nearly always guardians of some special relic or tomb in Ghol-Gan ruins, having been ordered to protect the object or location in life and remaining faithful to their duties even after dying. While they strive to keep their wards safe from depredations, gholdakos are nonetheless short-tempered and easy to lure away from their posts, though being caught by the undead giant almost always spells a gruesome and untimely end for most would-be tricksters. Dread Gholdako (+1 CR): Some gholdakos were created specifically to guard the tombs of Ghol-Gan royalty. Such dread gholdakos possess a bluish-white halo of smoke around their perpetually peeling scalps. A dread gholdako generally possesses additional Hit Dice, and can inf lict paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 10 + 1/2 dread gholdako's racial HD + dread gholdako's Con modifier) on its foes with its bite attack.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Ghol-Gan", "Source": "Isles Of The Shackles", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or guard (2-4)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(15d8+60)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 25, Dex 10, Con -, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 19", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2733, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Cleave, Critical Focus, Great Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (claws), Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claws)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "25, touch 9, flat-footed 25", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gholdako", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +22, Knowledge (history) +8, Perception +19, Sense Motive +11, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm coasts", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +5, Will +10", "Melee": "bite +17 (1d8+7), 2 claws +18 (2d8+7/19-20 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Large"}
