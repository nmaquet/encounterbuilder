In addition, they gain a +5 racial bonus on Strength checks made to break or destroy objects. </h5><h5><b>Hatred of Mirrors (Ex)</b> An abrikandilu loathes the sight of its own reflection. Using a mirror grants a +5 bonus on Intimidate checks against an abrikandilu. An abrikandilu adjacent to a mirror or attacked by a mirror-carrying creature (at the GM's discretion, some shields could be considered mirrors) must attempt a DC 15 Will save at the start of its turn. If it fails, it must focus all of its actions that round on attempts to destroy the mirror. </h5><h5><b>Mutilation (Su)</b> An abrikandilu's bite causes hideous, ugly wounds that not only mar beauty but supernaturally diminish a creature's sense of self-worth. A creature bitten by an abrikandilu must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or gain a -1 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. This penalty can stack as high as a -5 penalty with multiple bites and failed saves, and lasts even after the wounds are healed. The penalty reduces by 1 point every 24 hours. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Known as wrecker demons, abrikandilus delight in destroying beauty, be it the rending a fine painting to shreds, reducing a magnificent statue to rubble, or scarring a lovely face. Abrikandilus form from the souls of those who in life vandalized art or destroyed objects of beauty, particularly from those whose acts of destruction were born from jealousy. All abrikandilus loathe only one thing more than beauty-their own ref lection. Curiously, the countenances of other abrikandilus do not vex a wrecker demon, but the sight of its own deformed shape drives it into a furious anger. Abrikandilus are used often as ground troops in demonic wars, for they are excellent brutes on the battlefield and do not require weapons or armor to excel at combat. Their penchant for destroying works of art brings a demoralizing element to battle, for little remains after abrikandilus attack works of beauty. Even when they are defeated, the damage they've dealt endures, a constant reminder of the infinite value of what they destroyed. An abrikandilu stands 4 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "The Worldwound", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-12)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+5)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "improvised weapon +5 (1d6+2)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4665, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Sunder, Iron Will, Power Attack, Throw AnythingB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "15, touch 10, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Abrikandilu", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Appraise +6, Climb +10, Disable Device +8, Perception +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +7 (1d6+2 plus mutilation), 2 claws +7 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
