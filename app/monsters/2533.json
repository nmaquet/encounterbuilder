An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. </h5><h5><b>Breath Weapon (Su)</b> A mist dragon's breath weapon is a cone of cloudy scalding vapor. In still air, the vapor lingers for 1d4 rounds and forms a cloud that covers a radius equal to the cone's length; on the second round, the vapor condenses into a heated smothering fog that deals 1d6 points of fire damage to creatures each round they remain in the area (Fortitude save halves this damage). The fog also blinds creatures (as the <i>blindness</i> spell) that fail the save as long as they remain within in the cloud and for 2 rounds after they leave the area. </h5><h5><b>Mist Form (Su)</b> As a standard action, a juvenile or older mist dragon can assume <i>gaseous form</i>, but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. A great wyrm mist dragon's abilities while in mist form improve drastically. As a standard action a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can make a single melee attack of its choice at its highest attack bonus. This attack deals normal damage. As a full-round action, a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can attack with its breath weapon. </h5><h5><b>Mist Vision (Ex)</b> A very young mist dragon can see perfectly in foggy conditions (such as those created by <i>fog cloud</i> or <i>obscuring</i> mist). </h5><h5><b>Spell-like Abilities</b> A mist dragon gains the following spelllike abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-<i>create water</i>; Juvenile-<i>fog cloud</i>; Adult-<i>wind wall</i>; Old-<i>solid fog</i>; Ancient-<i>control winds</i>; Great Wyrm-<i>control water</i> </h5><h5><b>Water Breathing (Ex)</b> A very young or older mist dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Mist dragons are relatively passive (for dragons) and reclusive, preferring to spend their time away from most other races (including other mist dragons). Mist dragons make their lairs near large sources of water such as waterfalls, lakes, and seashores. A mist dragon resembles a gold dragon in shape and size. Its scales are shiny-blue white as a hatchling and gradually darken to a blue-gray color with metallic silver splotches.</p><p>Mist dragons usually spend their days moving from place to place in mist form. If threatened or angered, a mist dragon assumes solid form and attacks using its breath weapon, claws, and bite.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Credit </b>The Mist Dragon originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Copyright Notice </b>Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran, Aquan, Common, Draconic, Ignan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or clan (2-5)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d12+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 16, Wis 17, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "5 ft.
