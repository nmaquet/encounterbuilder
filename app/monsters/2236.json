Upon impacting a solid surface, the spores billow into a cloud that fills a 20-foot radius. The cloud lasts 1 round before dispersing. Creatures caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage and become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A successful save negates the Constitution damage but not the nauseated condition. Once a creature saves against this ability it is immune to the same ascomoid's spores for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Ascomoids are subterranean fungus monsters that exist on a diet of living creatures. Ascomoids feed by sitting atop a slain creature and absorbing its body fluids into its own form. Creatures slain in this manner appear as rotting husks. They generally avoid light and the surface world, though they have no adverse reaction to sunlight or bright light.</p><p>The typical ascomoid lair is a large, damp, dark, natural cavern with a single entrance and exit. Bones of its victims are strewn about the lair.</p><p>The monster itself does not collect treasure, so any such valuables found in its lair are the only remaining possessions of those its has killed.</p><p>The average ascomoid is 10 feet wide and weighs 300 pounds.</p><p>An ascomoid attacks by rolling over its opponents or slamming into them. Though mindless, the ascomoid reacts to those that attack it by firing spores at those opponents.</p><p>Credit The Ascomoid originally appeared in <i>Dragon #68</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 13, Con 17, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2236, "SubType": "(fungus)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 10, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ascomoid", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +3, Will +2", "Melee": "slam +8 (2d8+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
