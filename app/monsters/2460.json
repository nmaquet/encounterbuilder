The summoned lord or prince must succeed on a DC 44 Will save. If the save fails, it believes that Fraz-Urb'luu's opponents called it and deals with them appropriately (which usually involves killing the offending party for daring to call a demon prince or lord). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +15 racial bonus. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Fraz-Urb'luu is one of the most physically powerful demon princes as well as one of the most cunning. His deceptions range far and wide, affecting and influencing not only those on the Material Plane but also other demon princes and demon lords. His malevolent nature lends itself well to his trickery and deception, and he bends others to do his will.</p><p>Those that oppose him are quickly dispatched. Those he favors are often captured and taken back to his lair in the Abyss where they are forced into a life of servitude. When the day comes that Fraz-Urb'luu grows weary of them, he devours them or throws them to his other servants to do with as they wish.</p><p>He makes his home deep within the Abyss on a smoldering and scarred layer devoid of most life. His keep is a large iron and stone castle situated near the very center of the layer. A constant stream of traffic emanates to and from his castle; demons and slaves tending to their daily tasks.</p><p>Fraz-Urb'luu stands 18 feet tall and weighs about 8,000 pounds.</p><p>Fraz-Urb'luu opens combat by pounding his foes with his spells or spelllike abilities. He next assaults them physically by pummeling with his powerful fists and slashing with his tail. A grabbed foe is entwined in his tail and gnashed between the demon prince's fangs.</p><p>One of Fraz-Urb'luu's favorite tactics, after wearing down his opponents, is to summon a demon prince and then immediately teleport away as the prince arrives.</p><p>Servants of Fraz-Urb'luu Followers of Fraz-Urb'luu are usually evil humanoids and consist of clerics, politicians or aristocrats, sorcerers, and adepts. Devout followers of Fraz- Urb'luu are called Deceivers and must sign a pact of evil with Fraz-Urb'luu.</p><p>Deceivers can receive spells from Fraz-Urb'luu and are granted access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, Knowledge, and Trickery.</p><p>Credit Fraz-Urb'luu originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Daemonic, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Fraz-Urb'luu plus 2-4 nalfeshnees or 1-2 balors)", "Ref": "17", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(40d10+680)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 39, Dex 18, Con 44, Int 24, Wis 24, Cha 30", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2460, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Cleave, Craft Staff, Critical Focus, Deceitful, Extend Spell, Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (slam), Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Maximize Spell, Power Attack, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (prismatic spray), Staggering Critical, Stunning Critical, Weapon Focus (slam), Widen Spell", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "41", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "49, touch 29, flat-footed 45", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Fraz-urb'luu", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +57, Diplomacy +53, Disguise +12, Escape Artist +44, Fly +51, Knowledge (arcana) +50, Knowledge (history) +47, Knowledge (nobility) +50, Knowledge (planes) +50, Knowledge (religion) +47, Perception +58, Sense Motive +50, Spellcraft +50, Survival +47", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "29", "Race": "", "CR": "29", "XP": 6560000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "planar omniscience", "Saves": "Fort +41, Ref +17, Will +29", "Melee": "2 slams +53 (2d8+14 plus grab/19-20), bite +52 (3d6+14), tail slash +47 (2d8+21)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
