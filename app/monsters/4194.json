A knot of roots stands exposed, branching out from the base, raising the immense plant off the ground. Giant clusters of blossoms and pulsing nodules sprout from the plant, occasionally shedding a dim, repulsive glow. It's enough, almost, to distract from the writhing tendrils and the giant, oddly toothed clamshell leaves that betray a life no plant should have.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Moonflower</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 8</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>4,800</h5><h5>N Huge plant </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+4; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +10</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>21, touch 8, flat-footed 21 (+13 natural, -2 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>102 (12d8+48); fast healing 5</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+12, <b>Ref </b>+4, <b>Will </b>+5</h5><h5><b>DR </b>10/slashing; <b>Immune </b>electricity, plant traits; <b>Resist </b>cold 10</h5><h5><b>Weaknesses </b>vulnerability to fire</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>20 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +16 (2d6+9 plus grab), 2 tentacles +11 (1d8+4)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>15 ft.; <b>Reach </b>15 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>light pulse, pod prison</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>28, <b>Dex </b>10, <b>Con </b>18, <b>Int </b> 5, <b>Wis </b>12, <b>Cha </b>17</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+9; <b>CMB </b>+20; <b>CMD </b>30</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Blind-Fight, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth), Stealthy</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Escape Artist +0, Perception +10, Stealth +6 (+22 in thick vegetation); <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+16 Stealth in thick vegetation</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>telepathy (other moonflowers only)</h5><h5><b>SQ </b>pod prison, pod spawn</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary or cluster (2-10)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Light Pulse (Su)</b> As a standard action, a moonflower can release a pulse of bright light from its numerous blossoms every 1d6 rounds up to 3 times a day. All sighted creatures within 50 feet (save other moonflowers) with line of sight to the moonflower must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This save is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Pod Prison (Ex)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, a moonflower can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of a size smaller than itself by making a successful combat maneuver check. A swallowed creature is swiftly cocooned in a tight, fibrous mass and forced out of the moonflower's space into an adjacent square of the plant's choice. Once expelled, the creature remains cocooned and takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the living cocoon's pulsing, acid-filled innards. A cocooned creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the cocoon's insides (AC 15). Others can aid a cocooned creature by attacking with slashing or piercing weapons, but in addition to the damage dealt to the cocoon, the creature inside takes half the damage of an attack. Once the creature exits, the cocoon deflates and is destroyed. Other swallowed opponents are cocooned in their own pods. </h5><h5><b>Pod Spawn (Ex)</b> Should a moonflower's pod prison be allowed to kill and digest a Small or larger creature, 1d4 hours later it transforms into an adult moonflower with full hit points. The newly formed moonflower has its own consciousness, but some aspect of its trunk or blossoms resembles the creature that died within. The dead creature's equipment remains inside the new moonflower and can only be retrieved by killing the alien plant.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A fully-grown moonflower stands easily 20 feet tall with a massive trunk that is frequently 4 feet or more in diameter. The roots extend away from the base and into the soil, making the plant seem well anchored, but the roots themselves possess an agility that belies the great size of the plant and allows the moonflower to uproot itself and move with surprising speed. The tendrils of the plant are independently prehensile and writhe around the large flytrap-like \"head\" that crowns the stem. Bulbous growths and budding protuberances pulse and quiver along the alien plant's trunk and thrum with cosmic light.</p><p>Moonflowers have never been known to communicate with the natives of Golarion, even druids and others who regularly converse with plants. The plants do possess some manner of strange telepathy, though, being in constant communication with their nearby brethren at all times.</p><p>Those who manage to intrude upon the creatures' alien thoughts face an assault of horrible visions of terrifying worlds covered by jungles ancient, sentient, and malign.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "telepathy (other moonflowers only)", "Source": "PFS S1-36", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or cluster (2-10)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d8+48)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 10, Con 18, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4194, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth), Stealthy", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+16 Stealth in thick vegetation", "AC": "21, touch 8, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Moonflower", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Escape Artist +0, Perception +10, Stealth +6 (+22 in thick vegetation)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "pod prison, pod spawn", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +4, Will +5", "Melee": "bite +16 (2d6+9 plus grab), 2 tentacles +11 (1d8+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
