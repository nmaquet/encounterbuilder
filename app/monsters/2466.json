Large, curved horns,-the left one broken off midway from its starting point-jut from its head. Two large bat-like wings spread from his shoulders. The creature's body is covered in thick, dark hair.

If used in conjunction with <i>desecrate</i>, he can create 100 HD of undead with a single use. </h5><h5><b><i>Fool's Errand</i></b>: Sonechard's unique weapon is a <i>+4 unholy wounding heavy pick</i>.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Sonechard is a General in the infernal armies of Orcus and serves him- at least to all onlookers-with unswerving loyalty. He has countless numbers of demons and undead at his command. Though his true loyalty lies only to himself, he would never openly refuse a request by Orcus nor challenge his position as Prince of the Undead. Should the day come when Orcus weakens, Sonechard plans to be there to claim what he believes is rightfully his.</p><p>Sonechard makes his home in a large castle called <i>Chillhall</i> that sits atop a plateau of scorched earth surrounded by a moat of blood. The walls are constructed of bone and sinew, and it is said that the souls of those who cross him are entombed within.</p><p>Sonechard stands 14 feet tall and weighs about 3,500 pounds.</p><p>Sonechard is almost always encountered with a large number of demons or undead at his side. When he enters battle, he usually unleashes a <i>fireball</i> at his foes immediately, and then follows it up with a <i>circle of death</i> effect or a <i>suggestion</i>. Dying creatures are subjected to his <i>death knell</i> spell-like ability and then raised via <i>animate dead</i>.</p><p>Should Sonechard find himself on the losing end of a battle, he does not hesitate to retreat, covering his escape with summoned or created undead and demons. A defeat is not forgotten-or forgiven. He remembers his opponents, and sends his troops to exterminate them at first chance, bringing their carcasses to his keep where he grinds their remains into a fine powder and gives it to his servants to be used to spice up the keep's foodstuffs.</p><p>Sonechard's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Ignan, Infernal, Terran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Sonechard plus 1-4 wraiths or spectres, 2-16 shadows and 2-20 skeletons or zombies)", "Ref": "13", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(22d10+264)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 37, Dex 23, Con 34, Int 26, Wis 26, Cha 28", "Gear": "Fool's Errand", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2466, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Bleeding Critical, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Critical Focus, Deceitful, Great Cleave, Improved Critical (heavy pick), Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (heavy pick)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "25", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "46, touch 24, flat-footed 40", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sonechard", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +17, Bluff +38, Diplomacy +34, Disguise +35, Escape Artist +28, Fly +22, Intimidate +34, Knowledge (arcana) +30, Knowledge (history) +30, Knowledge (nobility) +33, Knowledge (planes) +33, Perception +41, Sense Motive +33, Stealth +27, Survival +33", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "21", "Race": "", "CR": "21", "XP": 409600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +25, Ref +13, Will +21", "Melee": "+4 unholy wounding heavy pick +39/+34/+29/+24 (1d8+17/19-20/x4 plus 1 bleed) or 2 claws +34 (1d8+13)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 80 ft.
