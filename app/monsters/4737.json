A creature that successfully saves against the baba yaga's aura is unaffected by the same baba yaga's aura for one day. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The target must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the evil eye is removed. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Intelligence-based.

If the creature fails a DC 22 Fortitude save it takes 3d6 points of damage plus 2d6 <i>bleed</i> damage. A creature that fails its save by 5 or more also takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. The bleeding can be stopped with a DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any magical healing. The save DC is Intelligence-based. </h5><h5><b>Spells</b> A baba yaga casts spells as a 12th-level witch (<i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's</i> Guide). They do not gain access to any other witch abilities. </h5><h5><b>Swamp Stride (Ex)</b> A baba yaga can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Long thought to be a solitary or unique being (similar to the medusa), sages and scholars have come to believe the baba yaga are in fact a race of evil crones related to the hag race. Perhaps this theory is accurate, or perhaps it is what the true Baba Yaga wants the world to believe; no one is quite sure what is true and what isn't when it comes to the baba yaga. A baba yaga makes its home deep in the darkest and most remote swamps and fens. There in the center of the swamp is her home: a large wooden hut perched atop two tall and muscular chicken legs. The hut is believed to be highly magical, ten times larger on the inside than it appears outside, and possibly contain portals to other planes. It is also believed by some to be some sort of construct or golem, though no proof of such claims exists. Surrounding the hut is a small dark picket fence which holds the skulls of the baba yaga's victims. The hut can lower itself to the ground so the baba yaga can enter, but it only functions if she chants, and it only functions for the baba yaga that dwells there. No other creature has figured out how to control the baba yaga's hut. Adventurers who have seen a baba yaga on the move say she moves through her swampy lair at in a giant mortar, steering it with a large pestle in one hand, and using a magic broom to sweep all traces of her passing with the other. This mortar, rumors say, can only be driven by a baba yaga or high level spellcaster, but again, no one is certain what the truth is. A baba yaga appears as a slightly hunched, old, and hideously ugly crone, with a large nose, long sharp teeth, and hands that end in wicked claws. She dresses in loose fitting ugly brown cloaks. When moving about in civilized areas, a baba yaga often pulls the hood of her cloak over her head, walks slowly, and carries a crooked and rotting walking stick.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Giant, Infernal, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or coven (3)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+48)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 19, Con 19, Int 23, Wis 18, Cha 19", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4737, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Combat Casting, Empower Spell, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Quicken Spell", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Knowledge (nature), +4 Perception, +8 Stealth in swamps", "AC": "22, touch 14, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Baba Yaga", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +16, Intimidate +19, Knowledge (arcana) +18, Knowledge (nature) +22, Knowledge (planes) +18, Perception +27, Sense Motive +20, Spellcraft +18, Stealth +19 (+27 in swamps), Use Magic Device +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "14", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate swamps", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "swamp stride", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +12, Will +14", "Melee": "2 claws +17 (1d6+5 plus grab), bite +17 (1d8+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
