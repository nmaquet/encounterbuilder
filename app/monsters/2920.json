Unlike normal orcs, black orcs move in daylight as well as they do the darkness of their subterranean lairs (they do not have the light sensitivity penalty that normal orcs have).</p><p>Black orcs were taken in early ages by Orcus the Demon Lord of Undead and bred with demonic blood in a matter that would accommodate his diabolical needs. Black orcs refer to their dark master as \"Old Man Death\". These orcs fairly worship death and display the death's head prominently upon their standards and devices. They are often found in the service of necromancers and move easily in mixed groups of zombies, skeletons, and even ghouls.</p><p>Larger and more intelligent than their lesser kin, black orcs look down on other orc races as inferior to themselves. When forced to cooperate with other orc tribes in large forces black orcs consistently plot to overthrow the other tribe's chieftain and take command. This treachery is likely the reason there are so few bands of the black orc nation known to exist, as the infighting tends to keep their numbers down.</p><p>Black orcs stand 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 280 pounds. Females tend to be about the same height, but are a bit lighter. Both males and females have blue-black skin with red eyes and more pronounced tusks than their smaller cousins.</p><p>Black orcs have a decent understanding of tactics. They are adept in the use of reach weapons such as longspears and glaives. Many of their number are proficient in the use of light crossbows. In melee they prefer to gang up on powerful opponents and dispatch them quickly before moving on to lesser foes whenever possible. As they are often led by clerics and necromancers in the service of Orcus, they are likely to take prisoners if possible with the intent of sacrificing them to the Demon Lord of Undead at some future time.</p><p><br><b>Black Orc Characters</b><br> Black orc leaders tend to be clerics or barbarians. Black orc clerics worship Orcus. A black orc cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Death, Destruction, Evil, and War. Black orc clerics favor spells that deal damage or create undead.</p><p><br><b>+8 Strength, +2Dexterity, +4 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma:</b> Black orcs are brutal and savage.<br><b>Darkvision:</b> Black orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br><b>AC:</b> +1 natural armor bonus.<br><b>Blessing of Orcus:</b> (see above) <br><b>Ferocity</b> <br><b>DR</b> 1/- <br><b>Light Sensitivity Weapon Familiarity</b>: Black orcs are always proficient with greataxes and falchions, and treat any weapon with the word \"orc\" in its name as a martial weapon.<br><b>Languages:</b> Black orcs begin play speaking Common and Orc.
