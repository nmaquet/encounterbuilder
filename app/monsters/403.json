The effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the bone idol's aura.</h5><h5><b> Inanimate (Ex)</b> An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise. Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves. </h5><h5><b>Mad Rage (Su)</b> Any creature bitten by a bone idol must make a DC 16 Will save or fly into an uncontrollable, violent rage. Those affected by this rage are treated as being under the effects of both the spells rage and confusion for 1 minute. However, whenever the affected creature rolls a confusion result that would lead it to flee or attack the bone idol, the idol instead chooses a target for it to attack. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Share Abilities (Su)</b> An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*). </h5><h5><b>Skills</b> In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies. </h5><h5><b>Zombie Fetish (Su)</b> Any zombie created within 30 feet of a bone idol rises as a fast zombie (see page 289 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for details).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Carved from human and animal bones and stitched together with hair, bone idols serve as grisly fetishes and totems for cannibalistic tribes. Although a number of small, nameless tribes carve bone idols in honor of obscure gods of disease and beastliness, most bone idols are fashioned to resemble the fearsome, simian appearance of Angazhan, the demon lord of apes and jungles.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "understands creator's language (cannot speak)", "Source": "AP 27", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 3, Dex 12, Con -, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 403, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Run, Step Up", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth amid bones", "AC": "16, touch 15, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Bone Idol", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +4, Stealth +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "inanimate, share abilities, zombie fetish", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +2, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +3 (1d2-4 plus mad rage)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Diminutive"}
