This is otherwise identical to an <i>animate dead</i> (caster level 4th). The animated creatures resemble zombies (and use their stats) and are under the control of the fogwarden that animated them. They are not undead however, and cannot be turned or rebuked. If the fogwarden is slain or moves more than 20 feet from a zombie, the animated creature collapses dead and cannot be animated again. </h5><h5><b>Electricity Discharge (Su)</b> Electricityconstantly plays across a fogwarden's form. Any metal object (including metal weapons) that contacts a fogwarden's body takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Magic items receive a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to reduce the damage by half. Nonmagical items and objects receive no save and automatically take full damage. A creature holding the object or weapon at the time of contact takes 3d6 points of electricity damage as well (DC 13 Reflex save for half). </h5><h5><b>Gaseous Form (Ex)</b> The fogwarden's natural form is that of fog or mist. This ability is similar to the <i>gaseous form</i> spell (caster level 8th), except that a fogwarden does not lose its supernatural abilities or its lightning bolt ability, and has a fly speed of 40 feet. It is immune to and cannot perform combat maneuvers. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)</b> Fogwardens shun sunlight. A fogwarden exposed to sunlight is staggered for as long as it remains in the sunlight, and is destroyed utterly after 1 hour of exposure if it cannot escape.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The fogwarden is sometimes called the ice apparition, for much like the standard apparition, the fogwarden feeds on the fear of its victims.</p><p>The fogwarden, however, is not undead. A fogwarden is usually found inhabiting the coldest and most desolate areas of the world. The fog surrounding it flashes with its life force. These flashes are often mistaken for the will-o'-wisp.</p><p>Fogwardens favor instilling fear and panic in their opponents to actual combat. In melee, the fogwarden attacks by launching a bolt of lightning at its foes. When a fogwarden is destroyed, it evaporates completely, leaving no trace of its existence.</p><p>Credit The Fogwarden originally appeared in the Second Edition <i>Monstrous Compendium Annual 4</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1997) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Wizards of the Coast.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (1-6 zombies [see text])", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 11, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 11, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2604, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (lightning bolt), Dodge", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 to Stealth to move silently, +12 to Stealth to hide in fog or mist", "AC": "16, touch 16, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Fogwarden", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +14, Intimidate +9, Perception +7, Sense Motive +4, Stealth +10 (+14 to move silently, +22 to hide in fog or mist)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold plains and hills", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "gaseous form", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +4, Will +4", "Melee": "", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 40 ft.
