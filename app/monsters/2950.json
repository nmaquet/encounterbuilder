A creature striking the lightning quasi-elemental unarmed, or a creature striking the lightning quasi-elemental with a weapon take this same electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. Metallic creatures or creatures using metal weapons take an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. </h5><h5><b>Globe (Ex)</b> As a standard action, a lightning quasi-elemental can discharge one globe of electricity per HD it possesses once per round. Globes hover by the quasi-elemental and move with the creature. An opponent that moves within 5 feet of a lightning quasi-elemental discharges a globe and takes the electricity damage shown on the table below. An affected creature can make a Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. Once a globe discharges, it is destroyed and a lightning quasi-elemental cannot recreate it for 4 hours. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Water (Ex)</b> A lightning quasi-elemental takes 1d8 points of damage per gallon of water it contacts. Pouring water onto a lightning quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level to a lightning quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against a lightning quasi-elemental.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Lightning quasi-elementals are native to the Plane of Air, the Positive Energy Plane, and a rumored elemental plane situated in between (the Quasi-Plane of Lightning). They are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane by wizards or clerics, but more often than not slip through a rift between the Material Plane and elemental plane during a lightning storm.</p><p>A lightning quasi-elemental can release small globes of electricity that hover around its body. An opponent that moves within 5 feet of a globe causes it to arc and discharge.</p><p>Credit The Lightning Quasi-elemental originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>EX2 The Land Beyond the Magic Mirror</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 18, Con 10, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2950, "SubType": "(air, electricity, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Flyby Attack, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 16, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Small Lightning Quasi-elemental", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +23, Perception +9, Stealth +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Quasi-Plane of Lightning", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +9, Will +5", "Melee": "2 slams +9 (1d6 electricity)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 60 ft.
