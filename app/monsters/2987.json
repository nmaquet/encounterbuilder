Creatures caught in the boiling water take 3d6 points of fire damage each round they remain in the area. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Creatures wearing heavy clothing or medium or heavy armor take a -2 penalty on their saving throw. In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell. The save DC is Constitution-based. Once the scylla moves from its location or shuts its heat ability off, the boiling water takes 3 rounds to return to its normal temperature (it still deals full damage during its cooling off period). A scylla is immune to its own boil water ability and to the boil water ability of other scyllas. </h5><h5><b>Heat (Ex)</b> A scylla raises the temperature of its body in order to generate intense heat. It does so as a free action. Creatures attacking a scylla unarmed or with natural weapons take 1d6 points of fire damage each time their attacks hit. In addition, a scylla can use its heat ability to boil the surrounding waters. </h5><h5><b>Scalding Blast (Ex)</b> A scylla can gulp some of the boiling water surrounding it as a move action. Each head that gulped water can then unleash a line of scalding steam on the scylla's next action to a range of 50 feet. The scylla can target the same or different opponents with each head, if it wishes. Each blast deals 3d6 points of fire damage or half that amount if the target succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is effective both on the surface and underwater. In any round that a head does not gulp water, it can bite. </h5><h5><b>Water Dependency (Ex)</b> A scylla can survive on land for a number of hours equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hour). After that, refer to the drowning rules in Chapter 13 of the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</i>.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Scyllas are thought to be related to hydras, though no proof exists connecting the two. They are found in climates from temperate to warm (they don't like the cold) and prefer to lair in natural underwater caves and caverns, only emerging when hungry. A scylla is a predatory creature, existing on a diet of large fish such as shark, octopus or squid, or unlikely swimmers and sailors. Prey is usually devoured in the same spot it is killed; rarely does a scylla return to its lair with prey except when nursing its young.</p><p>Scyllas are solitary creatures and even during mating season it is rare to actually encounter more than one of these creatures. The mating ritual lasts but a short time with the male swimming away afterwards, never to return to the lair. Young are born about 6 months later and reach maturity in just under a year. Young scyllas are noncombatants and do not possess the heat ability of adult scyllas.</p><p>A scylla is gray-blue to dark gray in color with a lighter shaded underbelly. Its fins are gray-blue to dark gray. Its eyes are golden or gray and each mouth is lined with triple rows of whitish-gray teeth. Scyllas can grow to a length of 50 feet.</p><p>Scyllas attack their foes with vicious bites from their multiple heads.</p><p>When facing more than one opponent, a scylla uses its heat ability to boil the water surrounding it and burn its foes. Scyllas prefer to attack when it is most advantageous, such as surfacing under a foe. If combat goes against a scylla it dives beneath the waves and swims away. A cornered or hungry scylla, or one defending its lair, always fights to the death.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+72)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 14, Con 23, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2987, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Critical (bite), Intimidating Prowess, Iron Will, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception", "AC": "21, touch 10, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Scylla", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +19, Perception +23, Swim +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any temperate or warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +10, Will +8", "Melee": "6 bites +16 (1d8+6/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., swim 50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
