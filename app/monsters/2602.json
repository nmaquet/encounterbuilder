The target can end the acid's effects by submerging the wound in water for a round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature grappling or swallowing the flumph takes this acid damage automatically every round it maintains this contact. </h5><h5><b>Stench Spray (Ex)</b> A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foul-smelling liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability, except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet - if the target fails its saving throw, it is nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 1 minute. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can smell it at double this range).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Flumphs are small, very strange creatures that spend their days floating along looking for food and water. They are non-offensive and only attack when actively hunting for food. Flumphs prefer the darkness of the underground and are rarely, if ever, encountered above ground. The average flumph is about 2 feet in diameter.</p><p>The flumph spends most of its time hunting small animals and vermin, which it kills and devours by dropping on them and piercing them with its acidic spikes. If threatened by a creature larger than itself, it fires its nauseating spray in an attempt to repel its attackers. If this attack fails, the flumph rises above its foes and drops at them, attacking with its spikes.</p><p>Credit The Flumph originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Ian McDowell and Douglas Naismith.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair or colony (4-16)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 16, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2602, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "0", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 14, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Flumph", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Diplomacy +2, Fly +18, Perception +7, Sense Motive +3, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +0, Ref +3, Will +5", "Melee": "sting +5 (1d4 plus acid injection)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., fly 20 ft.
