Creatures entering or caught in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract one of the diseases listed on the table below. A creature that saves is immune to the disease aura of that pestilential cadaver for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. <table border ='1'><tr><th>1D8</th><th>DISEASE</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Blinding sickness</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Cackle fever</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Filth fever</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Mindfire</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Red ache</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Shakes</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Slimy doom</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Roll twice, ignoring any results of 8</td></tr></table> </h5><h5><b>Fast Healing (Ex)</b> A pestilential cadaver's fast healing only works if it is within 30 feet of a fresh corpse. A fresh corpse is defined as any living creature killed within the last 24 hours. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> A pestilential cadaver is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: A magical attack that deals fire damage <i>daze</i>s a pestilential cadaver (as the <i>daze</i> spell) for 3 rounds (no save). A magical attack that inflicts disease heals the cadaver of 1d6 hit points per level of the spellcaster. A <i>remove disease</i> spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a pestilential cadaver. The creature can attempt a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half. A <i>heal</i> spell functions as a <i>harm</i> spell against a pestilential cadaver. </h5><h5><b>Sickness (Ex)</b> A living creature hit by a pestilential cadaver's slam attack must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become sickened for 2d6 rounds. A creature that fails its save by 5 or more is must immediately attempt another DC 15 Fortitude save or be subjected to one of the diseases above just as if it had been affected by the cadaver's aura. A creature that succeeds on the second Fortitude save is not subject to the disease effects of this ability for one day, even if it fails any subsequent Fortitude saves by 5 or more. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The pestilential cadaver is literally a walking disease, a construct formed from the bodies of those who died of plague and fever. It is ever active, seeking to spread its contagion to all who live. It rots constantly, losing flesh to decomposition, but gaining material from those it slays. Although it moves awkwardly, in fits and jerks, the pestilential cadaver is as swift and dexterous as a healthy man, even capable of running (though it rarely does so). It stands about 6 feet in height, and weighs roughly 150 pounds. The pestilential cadaver engages in combat primarily as a means of infecting new victims and absorbing their diseased remains once it slays them. It is a straightforward combatant, deadly even to those it does not touch.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Infernal (cannot speak any languages)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 12, Con -, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5027, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (disease), Alertness, Stealthy, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth", "AC": "19, touch 11, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Pestilential Cadaver", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Disguise +7, Escape Artist +3, Perception +6, Stealth +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +3, Will +2", "Melee": "2 slams +12 (1d8+3 plus sickness)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
