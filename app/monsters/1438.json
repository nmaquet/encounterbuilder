Though she is a living creature (for the purpose of <i>harm</i>less spells such as <i>deathwatch</i> and <i>detect</i> undead), she counts as either a living creature or an undead creature, depending on which outcome is more favorable to her (for example, rendering her immune to both <i>circle of death</i> and <i>undeath to</i> death). </h5><h5><b>Alter Objects (Su)</b> At will, the Arcanotheign can transmute nonliving objects into different shapes (as fabricate), transform solid materials into other materials (such as wood into stone or stone into metal), or imbue physical objects with temporary life (as <i>animate</i> objects). These transformations last 1 minute before reverting to their previous state, though the herald can extend this duration as long as she concentrates and remains within 1,000 feet of the transformed object. When animating objects, she prefers to create lifelike animals out of earth, stone, or wood, and can sustain up to four Large creatures at a time (treat as normal animals, except the animal's natural armor increases by +5, its type changes to \"construct,\" and it gains construct immunities). The Arcanotheign must be within 100 feet of the object to use this ability, and can only maintain one type of transformation (alter shape, alter material, or <i>animate</i> objects) at a time. </h5><h5><b>Corporeal Form (Ex)</b> As an immediate action, the Arcanotheign can take physical form, losing her incorporeal special quality and subtype and her deflection bonus to AC, but gaining a Strength score of 20 and a natural armor bonus equal to her normal deflection bonus. She can remain in this form indefinitely or revert to her incorporeal state as a free action (this happens automatically if she is knocked unconscious). This ability allows her to pretend to be a mortal and physically manipulate objects. In this form she looks like a tall woman with pale, gray, or black skin. </h5><h5><b>Eldritch Blast (Su)</b> The Arcanotheign's ranged touch attacks are incorporeal touch attacks that deal 4d6 points of damage and an additional effect chosen by the herald. A saving throw (DC 25) negates the additional effect (the exact type of save depends on what effect the herald chooses); a creature hit by two blasts in the same round suffers an increased effect if it fails both its saves against the eldritch blasts. The possible effects are the following: <i>Bleed</i> (Fortitude): The creature takes 10 points of bleed damage. <i>Increased</i> effect: The creature is disintegrated. <i>Dement</i> (Will): The creature is confused for 1 minute. <i>Increased</i> effect: The creature goes insane (as insanity). <i>Displace</i> (Fortitude): The creature teleports (as <i>dimension</i> door) 5 feet in a random horizontal direction at the end of its turn each round for the next 10 rounds. <i>Increased</i> effect: The creature is banished as if under the effect of a <i>maze</i> spell. <i>Ignite</i> (Reflex): The creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage. <i>Increased</i> effect: The creature catches on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage every round on the herald's turn for the next 10 rounds. The DC to extinguish the flames is equal to the save DC of the eldritch blast. <i>Paralyze</i> (Will): The creature is paralyzed as if by <i>hold</i> monster. <i>Increased</i> effect: The creature is slowed (as slow) when the paralysis ends or is broken. </h5><h5><b>Energy Channel Aura (Su)</b> The Arcanotheign's aura is charged with energy, whether acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative, or positive. The herald can change the energy type, suppress her aura, or reactivate her aura once per round on her turn as a free action. If the energy is positive or negative, it acts like channeled energy from a cleric, and the herald decides the effect of the channel (positive energy could <i>heal</i> living creatures or <i>harm</i> undead; negative energy could <i>heal</i> undead or <i>harm</i> living creatures). The aura's effect is always 2d6 hit points (Reflex DC 25 negates). A creature that is struck by the herald's incorporeal touch attack takes this damage in addition to the normal touch attack damage, and it gets no saving throw against this extra damage. The herald can use her Selective Channel feat to exclude creatures from the effect of her aura, regardless of the aura's energy type. </h5><h5><b>Resistance to Divine Power (Su)</b> The Arcanotheign has resistance 30 against damage caused by divine power, such as the non-fire damage from a <i>flame strike</i> spell.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The Arcanotheign is a mysterious creature serving the mad god Nethys. Because her creator sends her to Golarion on missions to <i>heal</i>, destroy, or spy, she is familiar with creatures of the mortal world, yet still very much an outsider, and she is fascinated by the intricacies of mortal interactions and history. In her natural, incorporeal form, she is a storm of magic, immediately recognizable as a creature of the arcane and divine. Ever curious, she often asks personal, direct questions of those she is sent to interact with, even as she repairs their wounds or tears their souls from their bodies. Sometimes she is told to assume a physical form, and lives among humanoids as a mysterious oracle for days or weeks, observing those near her and giving cryptic answers to those who dare approach her. She stands just over 7 feet tall, and has a habit of floating a few inches above the ground instead of walking.<b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> The Arcanotheign understands she is foreign to mortal life and mortal needs. She enjoys experiencing new aromas and tastes; someone wishing to get on her good side should bring her strongly scented flowers, a tasty meal, or some other physical object that may be new to her experience, even if humans would think it stinks or is inedible. She is interested in animals, and if she spends much time in the same place, she may \"adopt\" those living near her, especially orphaned ones. Some in the church suspect that her attention can cause mutations in these creatures, either directly or in its offspring, creating strange hybrids or magical creatures. The Arcanotheign has a lesser interest in children, though if a lost child finds its way to her, she is more likely to protect it or return it home than to ignore or <i>harm</i> it. Some of these children develop sorcerous power, typically with the arcane or destined bloodline.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> As a supernatural creature created in a moment of lucidity by an insane, omniscient god, the Arcanotheign is often left to her own devices when her master does not need her, and wanders Golarion and the planes searching for new sensations and meaning to her existence and that of the multiverse. She is a lonely creature and welcomes those who would speak to her as part of a normal conversation rather than an attempt to get information from her.</p><p>Her affection for animals is related to this; they are simple creatures who make no demands of her, and her habit of animating giant bears, lions, and other animals out of earth, stone, or wood represents her respect for animals she has known in the past ages.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Ancient Osiriani, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal, Protean; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "AP 41", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "14", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(18d10+108)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 27, Con 22, Int 31, Wis 20, Cha 27", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "2 eldritch blasts +26 ranged touch (4d6 plus special)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1438, "SubType": "(extraplanar, incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Casting, Command Undead, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Greater Spell Penetration, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (telekinesis), Spell Penetration", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "19", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Use Magic Device", "AC": "27, touch 27, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Arcanotheign", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Craft (alchemy) +31, Diplomacy +26, Fly +37, Heal +23, Intimidate +26, Knowledge (arcana) +31, Knowledge (history) +28, Knowledge (planes) +31, Knowledge (religion) +31, Linguistics +28, Perception +26, Perform (sing) +26, Sense Motive +26, Spellcraft +31, Stealth +29, Use Magic Device +37", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "18", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (extraplanar)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "corporeal form", "Saves": "Fort +19, Ref +14, Will +18; +2 resistance vs. chaos/evil/ good/law", "Melee": "2 incorporeal touches +26 (4d6 plus energy channel)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
