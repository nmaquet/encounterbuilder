The ritual takes 10 minutes to perform and the target cannot have been dead longer than one day per HD of the tombstone fairy. Additionally, the target's body must be present during the ritual and its soul must be available for return (that is, if the target's soul is trapped, such as by a trap the soul spell, this ritual automatically fails). A target unwilling to return to life can prevent its raising by making an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone fairy's Charisma check. If the tombstone fairy wins the check, the target's soul is forced into its body and it returns to life. If the target wins the opposed check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone fairy cannot attempt to raise that same target for one month. During the ritual a portion of the target's soul transfers to its funeral shroud or cloth. The tombstone fairy often retains this shroud so as to force compliance from the returned target. Once the target does what the fairy desires, the tombstone fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the target's soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a <i>resurrection</i>, true <i>resurrection</i>, <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>. This ability otherwise resembles a <i>raise dead</i> spell. A tombstone fairy can have only one funeral shroud (containing a target's soul) in its possession at one time.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Tombstone fairies are wicked beings that dwell within graveyards, raising murderers and evil heroes from the dead to go out and continue their deadly work. They often demand some form of repayment for the raising of such beings, keeping the creature's funeral shroud as a bargaining chip. This payment could range from magical or monetary treasures, the murder of a specific enemy and so on. Failure to make payment within 30 days usually results in the raised individual dying again. Upon payment, the formerly dead is given their shroud and is free to go about committing whatever foul deeds they <i>wish</i>.</p><p>Tombstone fairies are generally solitary creatures, but on occasion a small group of them comes together with a single goal: raise a small band of evil dead to further the fairies' own ends.</p><p>A tombstone fairy stands about 3 feet tall and weighs around 35 pounds.</p><p>Its skin is always slate gray and its hair is either dark brown or black. Its eyes are always black.</p><p>When pressed into combat, tombstone fairies fight with their wicked boning knife and spell-like abilities, seeking escape as quickly as possible.</p><p>If cornered, they fight to the death.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Elven, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or throng (3-5)", "Ref": "13", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(15d6+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 9, Dex 19, Con 14, Int 16, Wis 17, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3113, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Blind-Fight, Combat Casting, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 16, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Tombstone Fairy", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +12, Bluff +23, Craft (any) +11, Diplomacy +23, Escape Artist +22, Heal +18, Intimidate +20, Knowledge (religion) +8, Perception +25, Sense Motive +25, Stealth +26", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "14", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (graveyards, mausoleums, cemeteries)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +13, Will +14", "Melee": "dagger +12 (1d3-1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Small"}
