Even if this save is successful, the target must succeed at a second save (Fortitude DC 27) or be encased in <i>ice</i>. A trapped creature must succeed at a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 26 Escape Artist check to break free. Attempting to break free of the <i>ice</i> is a full-round action. </h5><h5><b>Disease (Su)</b> A target bitten by a khala must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or contract chillbane fever. <i>Chillbane Fever</i>: disease-injury; save Fort DC 17; <i>onset</i> 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage and target is sickened and fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves. </h5><h5><b>Tenacious Grapple (Ex)</b> A khala does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with its tail.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>It is rumored that the khala was a rare breed of amphibious dragon before Baba Yaga came to Golarion. Her arrival and the supernatural winter that came with her warped these once-proud creatures into voracious, wicked things that delight in the suffering of others. Each of a khala's three heads can strike at a separate target, though if two or more heads hit a single target, they cause horrific wounds as they viciously fight to devour chunks of its flesh. Along with suffering terrible injuries, those bitten by a khala risk contracting chillbane fever, a disease unique to Irrisen. The creature can ambulate like a snake, slithering along the ground or through the boughs of trees with its batlike wings drawn close to its body, but it prefers flight whenever possible. The khala's breath weapon, usable by a single head every 1d4 rounds, is a jet of freezing liquid that freezes on contact, trapping the target in <i>ice</i>. All khala are female, and scholars debate how the creature procreates. Some believe that the males of the species, known in legend as the zmey, were wiped out in a war with the khala prior to Baba Yaga's arrival.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Giant, Hallit, Skald", "Source": "Irrisen Land Of Eternal Winter", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "17", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(18d12+144)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 22, Con 27, Int 22, Wis 21, Cha 25", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3872, "SubType": "(cold)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Critical Focus, Empower Spell-Like Ability (ice storm), Flyby Attack, Hover, Improved Critical (bites), Improved Initiative, Staggering Critical, Stunning Critical", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "19", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "31, touch 15, flat-footed 25", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Khala", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Appraise +27, Bluff +28, Diplomacy +28, Fly +29, Intimidate +28, Knowledge (geography) +27, Knowledge (local) +27, Knowledge (nature) +27, Perception +30, Sense Motive +30, Stealth +23, Survival +26", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "16", "Race": "", "CR": "17", "XP": 102400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any cold", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "tenacious grapple", "Saves": "Fort +19, Ref +17, Will +16", "Melee": "3 bites +26 (2d10+9/ 19-20 plus disease), tail +26 (2d8+9 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 90 ft.
