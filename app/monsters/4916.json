Half-orcs are rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are usually forced to grow up hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to make names for themselves. Half-orcs as a whole resent this treatment, and rather than play the part of the victim, they tend to lash out, unknowingly confirming the biases of those around them. A few feared, distrusted, and spat-upon half-orcs manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and unexpected wisdom-though sometimes it's easier just to crack a few skulls. Some half-orcs spend their entire lives proving to full-blooded orcs that they are just as fierce. Others opt for trying to blend into human society, constantly demonstrating that they aren't monsters. Their need to always prove themselves worthy encourages half-orcs to strive for power and greatness within the society around them.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Orc", "Source": "Core Race", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-4), squad (11-20 plus 2 3rd-level sergeants and 1 leader of 3rd-6th level), band (30-300 plus 150% noncombatant plus 1 3rd-level sergeant per 10 adults, 5 5th-level lieutenants, and 3 7th-level captains), or tribe (1d4 bands plus 1 10th-12th level chieftain)", "Ref": "0", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10+5)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 9, Wis 10, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4916, "SubType": "(orc)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "warrior 1", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 10, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Half-Orc", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Intimidate +3", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "Male half-orc", "CR": "1/3", "XP": 135, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate hills and mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "chain shirt, club", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +0, Will +0", "Melee": "club +3 (1d6+2/x2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
