The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Lash of Fury (Su)</b> The mordnaissant can lash out with its negative energy powers and directly attack the vitality of living creatures, in the form of a twisting stream of black energy. The mordnaissant must make a ranged touch attack against its target as an attack action. If the ray hits, the victim must make a DC 22 Fortitude save for half damage or duration, depending on the specific effect chosen by the mordnaissant. The save DC is Charisma-based. The <i>lash of fury</i> has a range of 30 ft. with no range increment. The mordnaissant can pick from three possible lashes; it must make its choice prior to rolling the attack. The three options are: <i>whip the flesh</i> (as <i>inflict moderate wounds</i>, 2d8+9 damage), <i>whip the mind</i> (1d4 points of Intelligence damage), or <i>whip the soul</i> (stun 1d4+1 rounds). A critical hit doubles the damage rolled or the duration, in the case of <i>whip the soul</i>. </h5><h5><b>Lifesense (Su)</b> A mordnaissant notices and locates living creatures within 60 ft., just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. </h5><h5><b>Pain Wail (Su)</b> As a swift action, the mordnaissant can produce a terrible wailing sound that reflects the pain it experiences every moment of its existence. All living creatures within 20 ft. must make a DC 20 Will save or be dazed for one round. For every 20 points of damage the mordnaissant takes, the save DC increases by +1. </h5><h5><b>Shield of Agony (Su)</b> A mordnaissant harnesses the pain of its existence to shield it. It adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC and CMD.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Occasionally when a gravid woman dies violently in a place infused with unholy or negative energies, the unborn child within her does not perish, but instead continues to grow, vitalized by dark power, until it is capable of clawing its way free from its dead mother. This horrible creature, known as a mordnaissant, lives an existence of eternal pain, loneliness and suffering, relived only by its ability to inflict harm on those around it. Mordnaissants avoid bright light if they can, though they suffer no ill effects from it.
