The average wood giant stands 9 feet tall, weighs 900 pounds, and resembles a large wood elf. Wood giants have large heads and prominent jaws; their elf-like ears sit high on their long, oval heads.</p><p>Most wood giants (particularly males) are bald. Their skin is usually brownish-green. Wood giants dress in greens or browns and prefer neutral colors to the bright or dull colors of other races. Wood giants can live to be 400 years old.</p><p>Wood giants are on friendly terms with most benign creatures of the forest, particularly wood elves. Though contact outside their immediate clan is rare, they do occasionally have dealings with nearby tribes of wood elves. Wood giant villages are large and open expanses of land with few if any buildings or shelters. Wood giants prefer to spend their time under the warmth of the day and the serenity of the night. They do not associate with-and usually attack on sight-evil forest creatures.</p><p>Wood giants usually attack from ambush, hiding in dense undergrowth and firing at their prey with their bows before closing to melee with their greatswords.</p><p><br></br><b>Wood Giant Characters</b><br></br> Most wood giant chieftains are rangers.
