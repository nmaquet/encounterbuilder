In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below. A <i>control weather</i> spell instantly slays a wind walker if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. A <i>haste</i> spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to a wind walker. A Fortitude save halves the damage. In addition, a <i>haste</i> spell increases the damage the wind walker deals with its wind blast attack by +1d6 for one round. An <i>ice storm</i> spell deals no damage to a wind walker, but is affected as if by a <i>fear</i> spell if it fails a Will saving throw against <i>ice storm</i>. A <i>slow</i> spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a wind walker. A Will save halves the damage. A summoned or called wind walker is affected normally by magical barriers that restrict or inhibit called or summoned creatures (such as <i>antimagic</i> field). </h5><h5><b>Wind Blast (Ex)</b> A wind walker attacks using the air surrounding it, transforming it into a forceful blast that deals 2d6+6 points of damage to all creatures within reach. The wind walker makes a single attack roll at its full attack bonus against each opponent within reach as a standard action.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Wind walkers are creatures from the Plane of Air. They are often summoned to the material plane by clerics or wizards who employ them as guards. On occasion, a wind walker is encountered in the service of a cloud giant, djinn, efreet, storm giant, or other such creature.</p><p>A wind walker's natural form is that of a roaring and whistling column of wind about 12 feet tall. No discernable features can be seen in the wind walker.</p><p>A wind walker attacks by using the surrounding air to pummel its foes.</p><p>Credit The Wind Walker originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran, Common; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+21)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 19, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3432, "SubType": "(air, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Wind Walker", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +6, Diplomacy +10, Fly +20, Intimidate +10, Knowledge (planes) +11, Perception +11, Sense Motive +8, Stealth +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Elemental Plane of Air)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +9, Will +6", "Melee": "wind blast +10 (2d6+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
