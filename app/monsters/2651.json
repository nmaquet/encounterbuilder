The mummy golem makes a grapple check. If the mummy golem wins the check, it slips several bandages around the foe's throat and deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage in addition to constriction damage. The bandages can come from anywhere on its body, not just its arm or hand. Therefore, a mummy golem can continue to use its slam attacks, constriction, and strangulation attack against other foes. A Medium mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 4 opponents at one time using this ability. A Large mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 6 opponents at one time using this ability. A mummy golem is not considered grappled while it is strangling an opponent, and can move and attack normally, but it cannot move more than 10 feet away from an opponent while strangling it.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Almost always mistaken for a mummy (and sometimes for an adherer), a mummy golem is comprised of funerary bandages and wrappings sprinkled with mummy dust and held together by magic. The creature has no association with true mummies and is not undead so it cannot be turned or affected by clerics. Mummy golems are often employed by clerics and necromancers as temple guards or crypt and tomb guards.</p><p>A mummy golem stands 6 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Its body is composed of tightly knotted and rolled bandages held together by magic (and more bandages). Mummy golems cannot speak or utter any sound.</p><p>A mummy golem attacks by pounding a foe with its fists. It then grabs an opponent and attempts to wrap its bandages around its throat. If facing more than one foe, a mummy golem attempts to grab and strangle as many of its opponents as possible so it can concentrate on one foe.</p><p>Mummy golems are often programmed to react in certain ways to particular words or gestures. This programming allows the mummy golem to recoil if a cleric mistakes it for a true mummy and attempts to turn it. While cowering, a mummy golem simply waits for its foe to move within range before lashing out with its slam attacks.<br><b>Construction</b><br> A mummy golem's body is crafted from bandages, mummy dust, and exotic oils and spices that cost at least 1,000 gp.<br><b>MUMMY GOLEM<br> CL </b>8th; <b>Price </b>22,000 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirments </b>Craft Construct, <i>animate dead</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, creator must be caster level 8th; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Craft (weaving) DC 13; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>11,500 gp Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2651, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 10, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mummy Golem", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +2", "Melee": "2 slams +13 (1d8+5 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
