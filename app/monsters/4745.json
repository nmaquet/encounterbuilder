This deals 2d6 points of fire damage (in addition to constriction damage) to the grappled target each round the grapple persists. Once the grapple ends, the blaze boa's fire burns out. A blaze boa can stop and restart this ability as a free action (once per turn), but can only use it if it is grappling a foe.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Blaze boas are dangerous constrictor snakes found in jungles, warm forests, and swamplands. From the treetops they survey the area, ever watching for potential prey. These creatures sustain themselves on insects, wild animals, and small humanoids (particularly halflings and goblins). Cannibalism is not unknown among blaze boas. Blaze boas reproduce on average, once per year, with the female giving birth to live young after a gestation period of roughly 8-9 months. The female can birth up to twenty newborns at one time. Blaze boas are dark red in color when newborn. Young reach maturity within two years. Blaze boas can reach lengths of 40 feet or more, though the average blaze boa is 10-15 feet long and weighs 150 pounds. Its body is a crimson colored background overlaid with dark red blotches. Its eyes are emerald and set high on its head. Its tongue is the color of charcoal. Faint wisps of smoke seem to rise from the body of a blaze boa. Blaze boas lurk in treetops or just beneath the surface of the water, waiting for prey to come close. When prey is detected, a blaze boa strikes from its hiding place, wrapping the creature in its deadly coils. Prey that proves resistant to its constriction attack is subjected to the blaze boa's conflagration ability. Slain prey is either devoured immediately or carried back to the creature's lair to feed the young.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(9d10+27 plus 9)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 25, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4745, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Critical (bite), Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics, +4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "21, touch 13, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Blaze Boa", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +17, Climb +15, Perception +14, Stealth +9, Swim +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm forests and marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +9, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +16 (2d6+10/19-20 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
