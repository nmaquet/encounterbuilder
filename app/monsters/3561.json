They serve as a company of elite shock troops, kept a close secret and only used in operations where they are not expected to leave any survivors to tell the tale. Most shadow giants are especially taciturn and keep to themselves when not called to duty by the Umbral Court. They keep their own counsel and practice their own mysterious religion, whose bloody rituals of autosacrifice and cannibalism are presided over by their bone-and-feather-adorned shamans atop short-stepped pyramids constructed of dark basalt blocks. On the Shadow Plane, families of shadow giants have been known to combine together to form greater tribes when times of war are at hand. Such an army arrayed upon the field of battle is often enough to make enemies sue for peace with offers of gold and prisoners for sacrifice.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant, Shadowtongue", "Source": "Inner Sea Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), family (6-13 plus 35% noncombatants, 1 cleric or witch shaman of 5th-8th level, and 1 fighter or barbarian chief of 7th-10th level), or company (14-33 plus 1 fighter or barbarian chief of 7th-10th level)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(19d8+133)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 34, Dex 15, Con 24, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rock +16 (1d8+12/19-20)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3561, "SubType": "(extraplanar, giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Double Slice, Great Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (great terbutje), Improved Critical (rock), Power Attack, Two-Weapon Fighting, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "18", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception in dim light, +8 Stealth in dim light", "AC": "28, touch 11, flat-footed 26", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Shadow Giant", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +21, Intimidate +15, Perception +14 (+18 in dim light), Stealth +4 (+12 in dim light)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Shadow)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "militant", "Saves": "Fort +18, Ref +8, Will +7", "Melee": "mwk great terbutje +23/+23/+18/+13 (2d8+12/19-20 plus energy drain) or 2 slams +25 (1d8+12 plus energy drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Large"}
