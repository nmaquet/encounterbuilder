A mongrelman can produce offspring with any humanoid, mixing bloodlines in strange ways to create hardier crossbreeds. No two mongrelmen look the same. One may have a face that is half hobgoblin, half lizardfolk, with one human-like foot and one cloven hoof, while his sister may have elven ears, a dwarven beard, orc tusks, and clawed hands. Each mongrelman usually has characteristics from at least a half-dozen different races.</p><p>This strange mixture enforces mongrelmen's place in the edges of the world, for they are shunned by all who fear their twisted appearance. Mistaken as enemies by all, mongrelmen prefer to be left alone.</p><p>Most mongrelmen live below the surface of the world in hidden caves far from civilization. These creatures pride themselves on their survival skills, for the bowels of the earth are no place for weaklings.</p><p>Other foul and intelligent races who claim dominion in the underworld take mongrelmen as slaves (particularly morlocks), finding this deformed race's docile nature and hardworking attitude makes them extremely useful as tools of labor. In this role, mongrelmen still fall back on their pride of survival, slow to rebel and patiently waiting for the overthrow of their masters.</p><p>Mongrelmen dwelling on the surface sometimes live amid the hustle and bustle of cities, sequestering themselves in ghettos and sewers to avoid notice. Urban mongrelmen may rely on begging and pickpocketing to get by, but most form rural communities near trading routes.</p><p>Despite their varied physical forms, most mongrelmen average 5-6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 250 pounds on average. A tragically short lifespan limits the creatures' population growth-mongrelmen rarely live past 35 years.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Undercommon", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, gang (3-6), band (7-12), or tribe (21-30 plus 30% noncombatants, 2-4 rogues of 1st-3rd level, 1-2 oracles or witches of 2nd-4th level, 1 fighter or ranger chieftain of 3rd-6th level, 4-6 dire bats, and 3-20 dire rats)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d10+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1296, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Stealth)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Sleight of Hand, +4 Stealth", "AC": "13, touch 11, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mongrelman", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +6, Perception +6, Sleight of Hand +7, Stealth +13, Survival +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any ruins or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "sound mimicry (voices)", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +4, Will +4", "Melee": "club +4 (1d6+3) or slam +4 (1d4+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "LN", "Size": "Medium"}
