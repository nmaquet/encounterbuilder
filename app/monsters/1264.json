For most lhaksharut inevitables, this benefit equates to 5 additional attacks of opportunity per round. </h5><h5><b>Energy Bolt (Su)</b> A lhaksharut can fire bolts of elemental energy from two of its six arms-it never wields weapons in these hands. These attacks have a range increment of 100 feet and deal 10d6 energy damage of the inevitable's choice (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen for each bolt as it is thrown). It can throw two bolts of energy as a standard action, and cannot attack with these hands when it makes weapon or slam attacks with its other limbs. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Energy Spells (Ex)</b> A lhaksharut is immune to any spell or spell-like ability with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor that allows spell resistance. </h5><h5><b>Multiweapon Mastery (Ex)</b> A lhaksharut never takes penalties on its attack rolls when fighting with multiple weapons. </h5><h5><b>Perfect Prediction (Su)</b> A lhaksharut gains an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. </h5><h5><b>Wounding Weapons (Su)</b> Any weapon wielded by a lhaksharut gains the <i>wounding</i> weapon quality as long as it remains in the creature's grasp.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A typical lhaksharut is a six-armed construct that appears to be made of a mix of metals and stone. Where a human would have legs, it instead possesses a complex orb of spinning rings similar in shape to an orrery-it is this whirling machine that grants the lhaksharut the ability to fly. Though a lhaksharut has huge, metal wings, they serve as little more than stabilizers when it's in flight. Four of the construct's arms end in functional hands that it normally uses to carry a mix of weapons. The lhaksharut's lower two arms hold large, flaming metal spheres in their hands-it uses these spheres to generate elemental bolts of energy that it can hurl great distances to damage foes. Lhaksharuts are tasked with maintaining the separation between different planes of reality, especially the elemental planes. They do not concern themselves with petty trespasses by visitors from one plane to another, nor even the occasional creation of a pocket plane or hijacking of a chunk of one reality to serve as a base within another. What does trouble a lhaksharut is anything that represents a permanent link between planes, or an effort by the denizens of one plane to invade and conquer another. They often find themselves in conf lict with the machinations of powerful outsiders who seek to create beachheads on other planes to serve as launching pads for massive incursions.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "truespeech", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(22d10+216)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 31, Dex 13, Con 26, Int 14, Wis 21, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "2 energy bolts +21 (10d6 energy)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1264, "SubType": "(extraplanar, inevitable, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Greater Bull Rush, Greater Vital Strike, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Improved Vital Strike, Power Attack, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "25", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "36, touch 18, flat-footed 35", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lhaksharut", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +30, Intimidate +30, Knowledge (arcana) +24, Knowledge (geography) +24, Knowledge (planes) +27, Perception +34, Sense Motive +30, Spellcraft +24", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "22", "Race": "", "CR": "20", "XP": 307200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "perfect prediction", "Saves": "Fort +25, Ref +12, Will +22", "Melee": "+2 wounding spear +32/+27/+22/+17 (3d6+17/x3 plus 1 bleed), +2 wounding longsword +32 (3d6+12/19-20 plus 1 bleed), +2 wounding morningstar +32 (3d6+12 plus 1 bleed) or 4 slams +30 (2d8+10)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 60 ft.
