Dragonnels are semi-intelligent and use this ability to their advantage when hunting or stalking prey. Dragonnels are fierce hunters, though some have been trained by evil humanoids as mounts and guardians. A typical dragonnel is about 25 feet long.</p><p>A dragonnel prefers to attack from the air, flying above its prey and then plunging to strike with its claws and bite. A solitary dragonnel is usually either hunting or returning to its lair from hunting, while more than one dragonnel usually indicates a mated pair or family. In such a case, all dragonnels attack in concert with one another and usually fight to the death.<br><b>Training a Dragonnel</b><br> A dragonnel requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a dragonnel must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly dragonnel requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a dragonnel requires an exotic saddle. A dragonnel can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p><p>Dragonnel eggs are worth 4,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 9,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,500 gp to rear or train a dragonnel.</p><p><b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a dragonnel is up to 1,038 pounds; a medium load, 1,039-2,076 pounds, and a heavy load, 2,077-3,120 pounds.</p><p>Credit The Dragonnel originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pack (2-4)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 11, Con 18, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.
