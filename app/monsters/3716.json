This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not their saves are successful, creatures within the effect are immune to the Sandpoint Devil's bay for 24 hours thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Hellfire Breath (Su)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, the Sandpoint Devil can unleash a blast of infernal flame from its mouth as a standard action. This hellfire fills a 30-foot cone and deals 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 half ). Anyone who takes damage from this breath weapon must also succeed at a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming cursed by the infernal flames. Those who become cursed take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for a number of days equal to the damage taken, and during this time, the victim's skin appears to be horribly burned in places regardless of any healing applied. This curse effect functions at caster level 12th. The save DC for both saves is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Kick (Ex)</b> The Sandpoint Devil's hoof attacks are primary attacks that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>When residents of the small town of Sandpoint on the southwestern coast of Varisia speak in low voices about \"the devil,\" they mean the dreadful creature that has menaced the community and its hinterlands for over a decade. Then again, most people don't speak of the Sandpoint Devil if they can help it. They say the monster knows when someone is talking about it, and a poor soul who can't hold his tongue is likely to glimpse the creature's grotesque silhouette in the sky on the next moonless night-an ill omen indeed. According to legend, sightings of the Sandpoint Devil presage times of great woe, whether for a single person or the entire town. Sometimes, those who see the creature or speak of it too freely vanish in the night, never to be seen again. Precise descriptions of the Sandpoint Devil vary depending on whom you ask, but most people agree that it resembles a large horse standing upright on its hind legs with leathery, ragged wings; a reptilian tail; red eyes that burn through the gloom; and a fanged muzzle that gives the creature a perpetual evil grin. Some say the devil commands fog and wind, others say it breathes gouts of flame or can literally frighten you to death, and still others say it can do all this and more. Whenever livestock are slaughtered in their pens or children disappear from their beds, townsfolk are quick to blame the Sandpoint Devil. The beast is also denounced (quietly) when a building burns to the ground or a farmer's crops wither. In short, the locals hang nearly all their ills on the devil. But not all residents consider it to be evil. Some believe that the creature is an ancient guardian of the Lost Coast, and its actions in service of that goal, however terrible they might seem, are not for mortals to understand. Of course, hearsay and rumors only go so far, and most people outside the region consider the Sandpoint Devil a tall tale at best. At worst, they say it's a hoax perpetrated by simple folk looking for attention or hoping to draw travelers and adventurers with coin to spend.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Varisian", "Source": "Mystery Monsters Revisited", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+48)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 17, Con 19, Int 8, Wis 17, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3716, "SubType": "(native)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Hover, Improved Vital Strike, Mobility, Spring Attack, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "22, touch 13, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sandpoint Devil", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +12, Intimidate +12, Knowledge (geography) +5, Perception +18, Stealth +14, Survival +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "11", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Varisia)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +7, Will +11", "Melee": "bite +17 (2d6+6/19-20), 2 hooves +17 (1d8+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
