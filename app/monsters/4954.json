A ghirru closely resembles its original efreeti form, save its flesh is charred and hangs loosely about it, sometimes falling off in pieces as the creature moves. Ghirru haunt cemeteries, ruins, ancient temples to the efreet gods, and other such places. Legend speaks of a large lair of these creatures led by a sorcerer of vast power hidden somewhere beneath the fabled City of Brass. None have found this secret lair thus far. And few go looking for it. Ghirru have a taste for genie flesh, particularly djinn and marid, though the latter is often hard to come by on the Plane of Fire. When hunting on the Material Plane, ghirru are found in warmer lands, often near extinct volcanoes and other such warm places. A ghirru stands 12 feet tall and weighs around 1,500 pounds. Its skin is charred and burned, though in a few places the original crimson color shines through. Its body constantly emanates small wisps of smoke, and the smell of burnt flesh lingers in the air around the creature. A ghirru attacks with its claws and bite, attempting to grab its prey and set it on fire. A grappled creature is held and incinerated, then promptly devoured by the ghirru.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Auran, Common, Ignan, Terran", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pack (2-6)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d8+50)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 27, Dex 17, Con -, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4954, "SubType": "(extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claws)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "23, touch 13, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ghirru", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +15, Intimidate +18, Perception +19, Sense Motive +15, Stealth +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Fire)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "change shape (flame-spawned dire wolf; does not detect as undead in this form; beast shape II), genie-kin", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +6, Will +9", "Melee": "2 claws +15 (1d8+8 plus burn and grab), bite +14 (2d6+8 plus burn)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Large"}
