This ability functions as swallow whole, except for the following changes. An engulfed creature is trapped in the living lake's body, where the ooze inflicts automatic slam damage each round. In addition, an engulfed foe has no air to breathe and must hold its breath or risk drowning (see the <i>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</i> for rules on drowning). A living lake can engulf 1 Gargantuan, 2 Huge, 8 Large, 16 Medium, 32 Small, 64 Tiny, 128 Diminutive, or 512 Fine creatures. If an engulfed creature cuts its way free, living lake simply flows together again and can still use its engulf attack.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Hundreds of feet across, a living lake, also called an agrath-ogh in the language of the orcs, is an ooze of truly colossal proportions. The first living lake is said to have fallen from the heavens ages ago at a time so ancient that no eyes were around to witness its fall. The protoplasmic body of a living lake is fluid in nature and transparent in water, such that one of these creatures could remain unseen and unknown for centuries.</p><p>Unlike most oozes, a living lake is a not a mindless blob of muck. It is intelligent, but it is also highly receptive to the thoughts and beliefs of any large group of intelligent creatures that live near it. A living lake can become a god-so to speak-because of the will of the creatures that worship it. Thus, it responds in a manner dictated by its own worshipers.</p><p>The god is created by the worshiper, instead of vice-versa. Unfortunately for the world, living lakes are generally found in hills and badlands- the very same environs favored by orcs. Living lakes worshiped by orcs are cruel, chaotic, destructive things, since those are the qualities most revered in orcish deities.</p><p>Once it has been ensconced as a god, a living lake uses its abilities to live up to the expectations of its worshipers. It can reward a tasty sacrifice with a life-giving rain, or punish insolence with a plague of insects.</p><p>A living lake attacks by forming pseudopods from its oozy form and pummeling its opponents. A grabbed foe is constricted or engulfed in the creature's body, usually only released when it dies or falls unconscious.</p><p>Against powerful opponents, or those that press the combat, the living lake mixes its spells with its natural attacks, usually summoning animals or animating plants to help it. A living lake usually forms at least one pseudopod per opponent it faces. It can form a maximum of one pseudopod per 3 Hit Dice it possesses.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common, Orc, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(30d8+390)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 45, Dex 10, Con 35, Int 16, Wis 22, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "Ooze", "Reach": "20 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2783, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Combat Casting, Empower Spell, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Improved Natural Armor, Improved Natural Attack (slam), Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Quicken Spell, Spell Focus (conjuration), Toughness, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "Agrath-ogh", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "24", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Survival", "AC": "23, touch 2, flat-footed 23", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Living Lake", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Knowledge (local) +33, Knowledge (nature) +33, Perception +40, Sense Motive +8, Stealth +14, Survival +38", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "18", "Race": "", "CR": "22", "XP": 615000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +24, Ref +12, Will +18", "Melee": "4 (or more) slams +31 (4d6+17 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Colossal"}
