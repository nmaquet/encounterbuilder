The blood wight attempts a grapple check that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and claws its opponent with a +4 bonus on the attack roll. Attacks that hit an engulfing blood wight deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. An engulfed victim must hold its breath as long as it remains trapped or begin to drown. A trapped victim can break free with a successful grapple check. A Large blood wight's body can engulf 1 Medium, 2 Small, 4 Tiny, 16 Diminutive, or 32 Fine or smaller opponents.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>When a living creature bleeds to death on unholy ground, its corpse sometimes returns to life as a blood wight. Evil priests of Orcus, Jubilex, Lucifer and various other demon princes and devil lords often hold dark rituals where they bleed a living creature to death in order to create a blood wight. Blood wights generally detest living creatures, but if created by a clerical or necromantic ritual, the created blood wight will not harm its creator (unless attacked first). Blood wights are solitary creatures though occasionally more than one of these creatures is encountered (particularly when they have been created by an evil cleric or necromancer).</p><p>A blood wight stands 8 to 10 feet tall and weighs 400 to 550 pounds.</p><p>It appears much as it did in life but its body constantly weeps and oozes blood, even leaving footprints as it moves across the ground. Blood wights that could speak in life retain the knowledge of all languages they knew, but for the most part blood wights do not communicate either with others of their kind or with living creatures (including their creator).</p><p>A blood wight enters combat slashing with its claws. Given a chance, it grabs the closest opponent and engulfs it, holding it inside its body until it drowns. Drowned foes are ejected from the blood wight's body into a heap on the ground (the blood wight later devours any creature it kills).</p><p>A blood wight's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d8+36)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 15, Con -, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3430, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Death's Blessing, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claws)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Escape Artist", "AC": "21, touch 11, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Blood Wight", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +10, Climb +20, Escape Artist +18, Perception +20, Sense Motive +3, Stealth +11, Survival +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +6, Will +9", "Melee": "2 claws +14 (1d8+5 plus 1 bleed)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
