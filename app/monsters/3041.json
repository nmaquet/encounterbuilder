This attack has a range of 60 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only twelve feathers (3 volleys) in a single day. The stymphalian bird may use this ability in conjunction with its Flyby Attack feat.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Stymphalian birds are crane-like predators found in dense forests and lowland hills. They are voracious creatures that sustain themselves on a diet of livestock, cattle, and the like. They are particularly fond of the flesh of humans and elves, so always attack them on sight. A stymphalian bird has an ibis-like body. Unlike an ibis, however, the stymphalian bird's beak is long and straight rather than curved. Its feathers, talons, and beak are made of bronze.</p><p>A stymphalian bird attacks from the air by releasing a volley of bronze feathers at its opponents. It then swoops down and attacks with its beak and wings, flying out of range before its opponents can react. On the ground, a stymphalian bird slashes with its wings and stabs with its beak.</p><p>A typical stymphalian bird stands 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or flock (2-5)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "4 feathers +7 (1d4+2, 19-20)", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3041, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Improved Critical (bite) B, Improved Critical (claw) B, Improved Critical (feather) B, Weapon Focus (feathers)", "AlternateNameForm": "Bronze Beak", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 12, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Stymphalian Bird", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +7, Perception +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests and hills", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "2 claws +6 (1d6+2/19-20), bite +6 (1d8+2/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 70 ft.
