Although spawn so created are less powerful than wight lords, they are more powerful than typical wights, and are treated as wights with the advanced simple template. Spawn are under the command of the wight lord that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they become fullfledged, free-willed advanced wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. </h5><h5><b>Energy Drain (Su)</b> A wight lord inflicts a negative level each time it hits a foe with a slam attack. Like cairn wights, a wight lord can channel this negative energy through any weapon it wields, inflicting a negative level with each successful hit with the weapon. </h5><h5><b>Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)</b> While a wight lord is vulnerable to resurrection magic, it isn't quite as vulnerable as a typical wight. A <i>raise dead</i> or similar spell cast on a wight lord staggers it for 1d6+1 rounds if it fails a Will save, but does not destroy the wight. Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Dark princes and warlords of old, wight lords are undead monarchs. Where typical wights rise from a wide variety of individuals, wight lords rise from the bodies of despotic rulers or ruthless generals. Wight lords haunt the same ancient burial grounds and battlefields their lesser kin dwell in, but wight lords aren't satisfied by simply guarding their haunts against the living. They continue their reign as tyrants in death, ruling over undead armies and often compelling their unliving minions to wage war upon nearby towns or cities, sometimes even at the behest of bold and powerful necromancers.</p><p>The statistics that are presented above represent the minimum power level of a wight lord. A wight lord can rise from the remains of any cruel or sadistic leader, but those who were higher than 11th level when they perished retain some of their previous life's knowledge-although not all of it.</p><p>When this occurs, subtract 11 from the creature's previous number of class levels to determine the total number of class levels the wight lord possesses. Assign these class levels to the wight lord in a logical way-if it was a single-classed NPC in life, simply add more levels of that class to the wight lord.</p><p>Multiclassed characters and those who possessed levels in prestige classes require more creativity in applying the class levels. The goal for building such a wight lord should be to approximate the themes and general abilities the creature had in life.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Undead Revisited", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or platoon (1 wight lord plus 4-6 advanced wights)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d8+66)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 13, Con -, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 22", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1725, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (falchion)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "24, touch 11, flat-footed 23", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Wight Lord", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +15, Intimidate +20, Perception +16, Sense Motive +16, Stealth +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +6, Will +9", "Melee": "+1 falchion +17/+12 (2d4+11/15-20 plus energy drain) or slam +15 (1d6+1 plus energy drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.
