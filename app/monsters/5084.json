These gray, apelike humanoids are bred from human or apelike mothers, although the resulting progeny often kills the mother. Tombotu may mate with other tombotu. The tombotu are fairly intelligent aggressors and are often found leading dire apes, girallons, and other ape-like creatures, communicating with them through grunts and body language. Some humanoid cultures journey to the tombotu homelands where they conduct raids, capturing as many tombotu as they can. Captured tombotu are sold as slaves and used as opponents in gladiatorial contests where their ferocious skills are put to the test. Some few tribes of tombotu have actually made truces with other humanoid races, agreeing to sell off their children in exchange for food and other things the tribe may need. Such things are frowned upon by most other tombotu tribes, viewing those who engage in such practices as savages and traitors to their own race. Tombotu are fond of human flesh and often organized massive hunts where humans are the prey. Some tombotu tribes disdain this practice, feeling it makes them little better than the animals they ascended from. Others however, relish in the hunts, which can lasts for days at a time. Humans are also kept as slaves by many tombotu tribes. Even those tribes that look down upon the hunts keep human slaves. Most human slaves are house slaves, tending to the needs of the family, such as cooking and cleaning. In combat, a tombotu likes to attack using surprise, often hiding and dangling from jungle trees as its prey pass beneath, snatching up the unsuspecting prey and strangling it to death or breaking the neck of its quarry while it is held immobile by the tombotu's great strength. If threatened with death, a tombotu attempts to flee rather than face certain destruction.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Tombotu", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-6)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(5d10+15)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5084, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Endurance, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Tombotu", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +6, Climb +19, Diplomacy +3, Perception +11, Sense Motive +3, Stealth +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm forests, hills, mountains, and plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +6, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +9 (1d6+5 plus grab), bite +9 (1d8+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
