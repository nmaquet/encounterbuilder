When a dire corby charges, it can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies.

Though they make their cliff-side homes on the walls of underground chasms, where they climb and leap with death-defying agility, they are most frequently encountered in the tunnels where they wait to ambush prey, leaping down from the ceiling to rend and tear.</p><p>Dire corbies are intelligent, but have little use for society outside of the rough, squabbling pecking order of the rookery, whose social order is little better than that of the mundane birds the corbies resemble.</p><p>Along with the insane, near-suicidal savagery with which the corbies launch themselves into combat, the flightless bird-men of the Darklands are best known for their terrifying screeches, the often prophetic songs of doom and destruction capable of unsettling even the most robust and competent Darklands explorer.</p><p>A typical dire corby stands 5 feet tall and weighs between 125 and 150 pounds, with little difference between males and females save that the latter tend to be slightly smaller (though no less deadly). In addition to being savage predators, enjoying the mad rush of taking on intelligent prey even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, dire corbies are also notorious cannibals when it comes to their young, and a mother dire corby must carefully defend her eggs lest a flock of male corbies from the same rookery descend on her nest and devour the unborn children in a flurry of yolk and blood. This ultimately counterproductive tendency only further supports the impression most races have of dire corbies as dangerously unbalanced beings, and may explain why the creatures remain relatively rare.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo", "Source": "Misfit Monsters", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-5), hunting flock (1-3 dread corbies and 5-10 dire corbies), or rookery (1-10 dread corbies and 10-50 dire corbies plus 1 barbarian or fighter of 3rd to 5th level per 10 adults)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(2d10+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 12, Con 15, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1022, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics, +2 Perception", "AC": "13, touch 11, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Dire Corby", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +10, Climb +13, Perception +6, Stealth +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +4, Will +3", "Melee": "2 claws +3 (1d4+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
