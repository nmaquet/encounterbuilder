While their diminutive brethren measure several inches long, the monstrous variety measure 10 feet long and weigh up to 800 pounds.</p><p>The body of the giant hellgrammite is long and flattened, and generally ranges from dark brown to reddish in color.</p><p>The front third of its body consists of a well-armored head and thoracic segments, with stout, segmented legs. The head possesses a fearsome set of jaws, small antennae, and a set of clustered eye spots on either side. The posterior twothirds of the hellgrammite consist of nine densely haired abdominal segments, each with a pair of lateral filaments and gill tufts underneath for underwater breathing. The hellgrammite's abdomen ends in pair of terminal prolegs, each with a pair of hooks, which aid the creature in climbing or anchoring itself in fast-moving currents, and can be used in a tail slap to slash at its enemies.</p><p>The giant hellgrammite is a simple but ferocious predator. It latches onto its prey with its deadly jaws and proceeds to crush the life from it, feeding on the body after its victim can no longer struggle. The hellgrammite often attempts to drag the prey back to a protected area between or behind stream boulders, or down to the bottom of a deep side-pool. The strength of a hellgrammite's jaws is so great that, even in death, they clench tightly and do not relinquish their grip.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "AP 49", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+21)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 11, Con 16, Int -, Wis 9, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1836, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception (+8 in water), +8 Stealth in water", "AC": "16, touch 9, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Giant Hellgrammite", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +8, Perception +5 (+9 in water), Stealth +1 (+9 in water), Swim +7", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate rivers or streams", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +2, Will +1", "Melee": "bite +8 (2d8+4 plus grab), tail slap +3 (1d8+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
