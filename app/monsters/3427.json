This creature has developed a keen natural camouflage making them appear as a freshwater well carved into subterranean lairs. The entire well is in fact the beast with tentacles and devouring mouth drawn five feet beneath a rocky collar which protrudes from the ground.</p><p>Well lurkers are opportunistic and passive hunters, rarely seeking out their meals; they simply wait for something to wander too close to them and then strike. If food becomes scarce or the area around a well lurker's lair becomes devoid of life, it uproots itself and moves to a new location.</p><p>Such occurrences are rare however as the well lurker can go months without eating (and its rare for caves and caverns to go months without being explored by adventurer types).</p><p>A typical well lurker covers a 10-foot area, though specimens covering as much as a 30-foot area have been reported. A well lurker's tentacles are deep brown in color and about 10 feet long (longer on larger specimens).</p><p>Its maw is dark brown and ringed with many small tentacles. It can draw its grasping tentacles into its form and fold its mouth tentacles backwards inside its maw, thus appearing for all intents and purposes as an ancient stone well.</p><p>Animals can detect the unnatural presence of a well lurker and are generally nervous in its presence. Unless forced, an animal does not approach closer than 10 feet to this creature.</p><p>This monster's tactics are simple. It waits for beings to attempt to draw water from the apparently bottomless depth before lashing out with tentacles, attempting to draw prey into its fanged mouth, biting and devouring foes whole. Cutting oneself out from the well lurker is nearly impossible as they brace their girth against solid stone, meaning one would have to climb out through the mouth of the beast in order to escape certain death and painful digestion.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d8+60)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 11, Con 20, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3427, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Improved Grapple, Lightning Reflexes, Multiattack, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (tentacle)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 9, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Well Lurker", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +20", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +6, Will +9", "Melee": "6 tentacles +15 (1d8+4 plus grab), bite +16 (2d8+8)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
