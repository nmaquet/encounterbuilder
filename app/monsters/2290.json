In this form it gains two slam attacks. The transformation lasts indefinitely; changing back requires another standard action.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Burning dervishes are the fanatical minions of the Sultan of Efreet (see the <i>City of Brass</i> by Necromancer Games). It is said that the burning dervishes were once a noble tribe of jann who sold their souls to the Sultan of Efreet in exchange for greater power over the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p><p>Burning dervishes are virtually indistinguishable from human beings, and indeed spend a great amount of time in the Material Plane as agents of the Sultan of Efreet, seeking to spread worship of the Sultan as true God of Elemental Fire. Other tasks of the burning dervishes are as assassins and spies, often leading daring sneak attacks against foes of the Sultan or procuring powerful relics for his pleasure.</p><p>The burning dervishes have a citadel atop the Great Ziggurat of the <i>City of Brass</i> which serves as the central temple to their zealous faith.</p><p>It is from this ziggurat that the Sultan communes with his worshippers, sending them out on jihads throughout the planes to further his name and power.</p><p>Burning dervishes usually turn themselves invisible before attacking in an attempt to catch their foes by surprise. In combat, the burning dervish attacks with its falchion. Depending on the power of its opponent, a burning dervish either uses <i>enlarge person</i> on itself or <i>reduce person</i> on its opponent. A burning dervish that is outclassed or overmatched either takes to the air and flees or attempts to <i>plane shift</i> to escape.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Casey Christofferson.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Ignan, Infernal", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, company (2-4), or band (6-15)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+9)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 15", "Gear": "+1 falchion", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2290, "SubType": "(extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "Survival +2 when tracking", "AC": "17, touch 14, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Burning Dervish", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +13, Escape Artist +13, Knowledge (planes) +13, Perception +14, Search +9, Sense Motive +13, Stealth +14, Survival +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Elemental Plane of Fire or Plane of Molten Skies", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "elemental endurance, plane shift", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +6, Will +8", "Melee": "+1 falchion +14/+9 (2d4+7/18-20), or 2 slams +13 (1d6+4 plus 1d6 fire plus burn) (flame form only)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 20 ft.
