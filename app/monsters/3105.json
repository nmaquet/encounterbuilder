They are rarely encountered anywhere else (save the Paraelemental Plane of Heat occasionally). Once in a rare while a gang or band of these creatures stumble through a vortex and sets up their nest on the Material Plane. Such a nest is always located near a massive heat source (such as a volcano).</p><p>On their home plane, thermites build large underground nests. The bulk of the colony is maintained by the workers-whose job it is to construct the nest, forage for food, feed the queen and soldiers, and repair the nest. Soldiers defend the nest against intruders and trespassers. About a week after the nest is finished, the queen takes a king (use the worker thermite's statistics) and they construct a reproduction chamber where she lays 10-20 eggs each day over a period of a week. Young thermites are helpless and depend solely on the queen and workers for food, protection, and so on. Young become independent after several months, and the reproductives (winged thermites) fly off to form their own nests.</p><p>The cycle above then repeats. (Winged thermites have a fly speed of 50 feet with average maneuverability.) Thermites are red in color and about 5 or 6 feet long with large biting mandibles and segmented antennae. Soldiers are slightly larger than workers and have slightly larger heads with oversized mandibles. The queen can reach a length of 12 feet or longer and as she ages, she becomes bloated, resembling a giant reddish colored maggot. Reproductives resemble workers and soldiers but are slightly darker in color and have translucent reddish wings.</p><p>Thermites are generally passive creatures except when their nest is attacked. In such an event, the soldiers move to defend the young and the queen. Workers join in the melee fighting off any would-be interlopers.</p><p>Thermites attack by biting with their mandibles. Slain creatures are often dragged into the lair and fed to the queen and the young.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "nest (1 plus 10-40 workers and 5-10 soldiers)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d8+27)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 14, Con 17, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3105, "SubType": "(extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 11, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Queen Thermite", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Elemental Plane of Fire)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +5, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +9 (2d6+6 plus 2d6 fire plus burn)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
