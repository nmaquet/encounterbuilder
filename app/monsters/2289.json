Frenzied bunyips attack until either they or their opponents are dead. A frenzied bunyip can make one extra attack when making a full attack action. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack. Additionally, it gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves (none of which are included in the statistic block above). A frenzied bunyip's swim speed increases by 10 feet (to 60 feet). This frenzy lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds) and can only be used once per encounter.</h5><h5><b> Keen Scent (Ex)</b> Bunyips can notice creatures by scent in a 90-foot radius and detect blood in the water at ranges of up to one-half mile. </h5><h5><b>Roar (Su)</b> When a bunyip roars, all creatures with 4 or less HD within a 100-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mindaffecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the roar of that bunyip for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5><h5><b> Vorpal Bite (Ex)</b> If a bunyip scores a natural 20 on its attack roll and confirms the critical hit, it severs one of the opponent's extremities (roll 1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The bunyip is about 6 feet long, though specimens of up to 10 feet long have been encountered.</p><p>Bunyips do not attack creatures larger than themselves, except in self-defense or if they detect blood in the water. They begin combat using their powerful roar and then bite opponents who do not succumb to the fear-inducing effects of their roar.</p><p>Credit The Bunyip originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Dermot Jackson.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+15)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 16, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2289, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "modifies Swim with Str or Dex", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Bunyip", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +11, Swim +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +7, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +8 (2d6+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
