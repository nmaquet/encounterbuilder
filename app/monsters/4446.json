He gains a bonus equal to his Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), the trench fighter picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well. Furthermore, when behind partial, normal, or improved cover, a trench fighter gains an additional +2 AC bonus from the cover. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4. </h5><h5><b>Symbiote (Ex)</b> A unique relationship with trench mists grants trench zombies immunity to acid. In addition, when a trench zombie reaches 0 hit points and is destroyed, the mustard-colored mist that animates the creature bursts violently from its damaged form. All creatures adjacent to the trench zombie are exposed to the toxic gas and take 4d6 points of acid damage. If the trench zombie is enveloped within the fog of its parent trench mist when this death burst occurs, the mist's fast healing ability increases by 1 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the destroyed trench zombie. The effects of the deaths of multiple symbiotic trench zombies stack.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A trench zombie is a rotting creature leaking sulfurous fumes from beneath its acid-burned, peeling skin, and bristling with the armaments it possessed in its horrifying death. Retaining many of the memories and skills it possessed in life, a trench zombie contributes its intelligence into a sort of hive mind for the trench mist that originally spawned it, creating a true symbiosis between the two-a gift the trench zombie repays upon its destruction, when the horrific fumes that granted it unlife go back to the trench mist that birthed it. Trench zombies are foul and vengeful, and are canny enough to lurk within the nurturing embrace of their mother mist, which provides them concealment without impairing their senses. Those seeking trench zombies' destruction typically must enter the engulfing body of a trench mist if they are to ward off the zombies' ranged attacks. Trench zombies are created using the juju zombie template (<i>Bestiary 2</i> 291), but they lose the juju zombie's immunity to <i>magic missile</i>, which is replaced by immunity to acid. Trench zombies also gain the following special ability Symbiote (Ex).</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Russian", "Source": "AP 71", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or horror (3-5)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10++6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 18, Con -, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8", "Gear": "M1914 concussion grenades (2, see page 66); Other Gear Mosin-Nagant M1891 rifle (see page 65) with 20 metal cartridges, socket bayonet (see page 67), gas mask (see page 67)", "Ranged": "Mosin-Nagant M1891 rifle +12/+7 (1d10+6/x4) or M1914 concussion grenade +10 (3d6)", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4446, "SubType": "(augmented human, human)", "MonsterSource": "see page 67", "Feats": "Deadly Aim, Dodge, Improved InitiativeB, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Toughness, Weapon Focus (rifle), Weapon Specialization (rifle)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "fighter (trench fighter) 6", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Climb", "AC": "18, touch 15, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Trench Zombie", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +15, Craft (firearms) +4, Knowledge (engineering) +4, Perception +7, Profession (soldier) +5, Ride +8, Stealth +10, Survival +5", "ClassArchetypes": "trench fighter", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "+3 (+2 vs. fear)", "Race": "Human", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "symbiote", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +6, Will +3 (+2 vs. fear)", "Melee": "socket bayonet +9/+4 (1d6+3) or slam +9 (1d6+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "LN", "Size": "Medium"}
