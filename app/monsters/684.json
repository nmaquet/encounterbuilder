The opponent must be corporeal and at least one size category smaller than the hodag. If the hodag's maneuver succeeds, its opponent is thrown back 10 feet (in a direction chosen by the hodag) and falls prone. The hodag can only toss its opponent in a straight line. If an obstacle prevents the creature's movement, both the creature tossed and the object struck take 1d6 points of damage, and the creature falls prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. A hodag can also toss an opponent straight up into the air. This does not move the opponent but causes it to take an additional 1d6 points of damage from falling. </h5><h5><b>Trackless (Ex)</b> A hodag sweeps its tail behind itself in a way that obscures its tracks. Attempts to track a hodag have their normal DC increased by 10.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>As stout as a bull, with a reptile's scaly, spiked body, hodags are fierce forest predators hunting along the edges of civilization in the thick woods. Green, gray, and black scales cover the beasts, helping them to blend in amid the underbrush, and sharp spikes stand along their backs and run down their powerful, dangerous tails. Loggers share stories of being followed by hodags and seeing their glowing red eyes in the oppressive darkness of the thick forest. In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets the region, hodags grow a foul-smelling coat of greasy, dark brown fur, sprouting in tufts from between their scales and helping them blend in with dead vegetation. Males sport large curving spikes on their heads that look like forward-facing horns. Many believe that hodags are not true-breeding beasts but rather a unique and specific terror that has lived and hunted certain woodlands for ages. Many regional people living near such wildernesses consider hodags a myth, nothing more than the sort of tall tale that is typical of excitable rural folk. Some go so far to use \"hodagger\" as a derogatory term for the more rustic and simple people working the forests and rivers. Folklorists say the first hodag rose from the charred remains of an ox sacrificed to cleanse foul spirits. The ritual failed on the seventh day of burning, and this foul beast climbed from the pyre and devoured those performing the rites as a putrid smell spread through the forest like a rancid fog. Superstitious lumberjacks refuse to work when similar fogs hang thick in the woods, even though many who don't know or don't care about such tales claim such fogs are perfectly natural or mere swamp gases. The oral tradition passed down from the people living in regions hunted by hodags tells that the name comes from the combination of \"horse\" and \"dog,\" two of the beast's favorite meals. A typical male hodag measures over 10 feet from the snout to the tip of the tail and 4-1/2 feet at the shoulder, though when they rear back on two legs, they reach far more intimidating heights. Females tend to be a foot or more smaller but are stockier; both male and female hodags weigh around 700 pounds. Female hodags also lack horns (female hodags have no gore or toss attack and are CR 4).<b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> Hodags do not typically seek out creatures to hunt. Rather, the unpredictable beasts wander the forest and countryside in the hope of something crossing their paths. If a hodag becomes interested-something that seems to depend wholly on the appeal of a being's scent or appearance-it will follow and stalk a creature, unwilling to stop until it has fed upon its prey. Hodags sometimes stalk their prey for weeks, some say to fill victims with fear and panic, making them thinner. They tend to prefer lean meals that provide considerable crunching sounds as they are consumed. Some tales claim the beast doesn't feed upon the actual bodies of its victims but rather on the fear of those about to be consumed and the pleasure of the crunch. The scene of a hodag attack appears to back up this claim, as the beast dismembers and shreds its victims, throwing viscera and body parts about the area and consuming very little actual meat. This is actually due to the eating habits of the creature. While they enjoy killing at any time, hodags gorge themselves only once every 3 months. During these feasts, they can eat an entire herd of horses, consuming thousands of pounds of food in one attack.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> Extremely secluded and territorial creatures, hodags are rarely seen together. During mating season, hodags expand their usual hunting grounds and wander farther from their dens on the chance that they may find a mate. The courtship is abrupt and to the point, and after the act of breeding, the two hodags depart in opposite directions. The female hodag finds an isolated place in the forest and digs a den in which to birth her young. Despite their reptilian appearance, hodags do not lay eggs but rather give live birth to a small litter of no more than three or four young. Sibling rivalry is strong and play is often rough. Not all young hodags survive this competition, ensuring only the strongest of the litter make it to maturity. Hodags on Golarion Tales of hodags and hodag-like creatures fill the legends of several regions and backwaters across Avistan. Noted here are three locations where the myth of the hodag takes on a fearsome life. </h5><h5><b>Falcon's Hollow:</b> The thick woods surrounding Falcon's Hollow in Andoran echo with cautionary tales offered to children and apprentice lumberjacks of a particularly massive hodag missing an eye. Everyone knows someone who claims her great-great-granddad was responsible for plucking out the eye of this frightening beast or was a companion of the one responsible. There are as many stories about how it happened as there are surnames of those said to be responsible. </h5><h5><b>The Chitterwood:</b> In southern Isger, a foul hodag hunts without end. Oral tradition from the region places this dark beast there long before man settled, and storytellers claim the creature is actually a living shadow in the terrifying form of a hodag. The only safety from the beast lies in sunlight, something not always in great supply deep in the heart of the wood. </h5><h5><b>The Lower Sellen:</b> In the southern part of the River Kingdoms, where the Sellen River collects its tributaries into a mighty torrent flowing toward the lands downstream, tales of a hodag capable of flight keep travelers watching the skies as they move through the region. Stories dispute the origin of this terrible beast, with some claiming the creature resulted from a mad druid's magic and others saying its mother was a powerful manticore. The mysterious claw marks high in several of the region's trees are cited as evidence of the beast's fearsome climbing ability.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "understands Common", "Source": "AP 32", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+16)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 684, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Critical (bite), Iron Will, Multiattack, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 11, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Hodag", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +10, Perception +7, Stealth +2, Swim +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests and marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "trackless", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +8, Will +5", "Melee": "bite +11 (1d10+4/19-20), 2 claws +11 (1d6+4), gore +11 (1d8+4; males only), tail slap +9 (1d8+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
