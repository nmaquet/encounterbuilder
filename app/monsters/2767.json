They generally avoid contact with civilized races, preferring the seclusion of their homeland above all else.</p><p>Kathlin congregate in herds and two types of herds can be encountered; bachelor or mixed. A bachelor herd consists of all males. Each male in such a herd is young and hasn't reached full maturity yet. The second type of kathlin herd is a mixed herd that contains both females and males. In a mixed herd there will always be at least one male for every three females (its part of the harem-like structure of the kathlin society).</p><p>When a bachelor male reaches maturity, it leaves the bachelor herd and seeks out a mixed herd where it selects up to three females to mate with.</p><p>Should the kathlin select a female that is mated with another male, a battle ensues. The male that wins this fight claims the female as its own.</p><p>Kathlins can be trained as mounts or beasts of burden. Young are usually easier to train than older kathlins, and males make better mounts than females. They can also be trained to serve as a mount in combat.</p><p>They are fearless creatures and do quite well in such situations. Trained properly, a kathlin makes an excellent combat steed. When fighting, a kathlin rears back on its hind legs and slashes with its hooves or gnashes at a foe with its bite.</p><p>Non-domesticated or untrained kathlin back away from combat if overwhelmed. They do not do so out of fear, but are intelligent enough to know when they are beaten.<br><b>Training a Kathlin</b><br> A kathlin requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a kathlin must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly kathlin requires six weeks of work and a successful DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a kathlin does not require an exotic saddle. A kathlin can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she makes a successful Ride check.</p><p>Kathlin young are worth 5,000 gp on the open market. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a kathlin.<br><b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a kathlin is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301 to 600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601 to 900 pounds. A kathlin can drag 4,500 pounds.<br><b>Paladin's Mount</b><br> A paladin of 6th level or higher may call a kathlin as his or her special mount.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or herd (4-13)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 5, Wis 13, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2767, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Endurance, Run", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Kathlin", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "great endurance", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "4 hooves +7 (1d6+4), bite +7 (1d4+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "NG", "Size": "Large"}
