As fast as the greatest angels, he leads the charge when her celestial armies must go to war. A veteran of countless sorties into the Abyss, the Hand fights with a song of battle on his lips and unbreakable courage in his heart. He looks like a tall, golden-skinned angel with a halo of sword-like blades, which he can also wear on his arm like a spiked shield. He may manifest or hide a pair of feathered wings at will, which may be any color, though he does not actually need them to fly.</p><p>The Hand is not a diplomatic angel, and Iomedae rarely calls upon him when the situation requires someone willing to mince words. He once served the Empyreal Lord Ragathiel (at which time he was called the Hand of Vengeance) but asked to serve Iomedae after Aroden died, as she needed a hero to be her champion.</p><p><b>Ecology</b><br> The Hand of the Inheritor does not need to eat or sleep, though he is known to take a long pause after a great battle to think about fallen comrades with other veterans.</p><p>He refers to Iomedae as \"My Lady, the Just Queen of Heaven,\" and treats her as if he were a knight holding a chaste adoration for a righteous courtly lady. His haloshield is called the Brightsword, and he sometimes refers to it as if it were an independent being, though it acts according to his will; as a free action he can pull a +2 longsword from the halo-shield at any time and wield it as a weapon, though the sword vanishes if ever separated from him.</p><p><b>Habitat & Society</b><br> The angel focuses on honorable combat, the preservation of just rulers, and valorous deeds. When he is not needed on Golarion, he guards noble souls through the Astral to Pharasma's court, patrols the borders of Iomedae's realm in search of abominations from the Abyss, duels devils on neutral ground to better learn their tactics, and watches over youths his patron has marked for greatness.</p><p>He enjoys battle hymns and marching music, though his voice is more suited for harmonizing with a true performer than leading a song. He is adept at determining if a rampaging monster intends evil or if it is merely hungry, and is merciful enough to only slay the ones intending to do wrong. Likewise, he feels no guilt in slaying those who embrace evil, but strikes to subdue when his opponent is magically controlled or otherwise compromised in his decision-making.</p><p>Though he is actually older than Iomedae, he defers to her divine wisdom and experience as a mortal, for he understands his perspective as an immortal angel living in the realms beyond Golarion is very different and sometimes emotionally distant from the thoughts and concerns of humanity. He is an ally of the heralds of Sarenrae and Shelyn, but is wary of the herald of Cayden Cailen, for that one's overt sexuality makes him slightly uncomfortable (as he spent thousands of years serving the Empyreal Lord of chastity).</p><p><b>Heralds of the Gods: Revisited</b><br> The Hand of the Inheritor stands among a special class of unique, godly servants known as heralds. With few exceptions, every one of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes and upon the mortal realm. While not necessarily the most powerful of a deity's minions, heralds embody fundamental elements of a god's faiths and philosophies, and thus prove particularly suited to interactions with mortal worshipers-although a herald appears only at the direct order of a deity, not merely because a powerful cleric requires aid. Thus, heralds are creatures myth, and their appearances mark lives and events of legend.</p><p>In the Pathfinder RPG, heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via the spell greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the Hand of the Inheritor. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.</p><p>Currently, the statistics for eight heralds have appeared in Pathfinder Adventure Paths, while all of these divine emissaries are described in Pathfinder Chronicles: Gods & Magic.</p><p> <table> <tr><th>Herald</th><th>Deity</th><th>Volume</th></tr> <tr><td>Yethazmari</td><td>Lamashtu</td><td>Pathfinder #5</td></tr> <tr><td>The Night Monarch</td><td>Desna</td><td>Pathfinder #5</td></tr> <tr><td>The Lawgiver</td><td>Abadar</td><td>Pathfinder #8</td></tr> <tr><td>The Prince in Chains</td><td>Zon-Kuthon</td><td>Pathfinder #11</td></tr> <tr><td>Thais Cayden</td><td>Cailean</td><td>Pathfinder #14</td></tr> <tr><td>The Menotherian</td><td>Calistria</td><td>Pathfinder #17</td></tr> <tr><td>Sunlord Thalachos</td><td>Sarenrae</td><td>Pathfinder #20</td></tr> </table> </p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Draconic, Infernal; truespeech", "Source": "AP 26", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or squad (the Hand plus 2-5 astral devas)", "Ref": "16", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(18d10+108)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 25, Dex 21, Con 22, Int 22, Wis 24, Cha 23", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 372, "SubType": "(angel, extraplanar, good, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Improved Initiative, Improved Shield Bash, Power Attack, Shield Master, Shield Slam, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (longsword), Weapon Focus (spiked shield)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "17", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "33, touch 14, flat-footed 28", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Hand of the Inheritor", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Craft (weaponsmithing) +27, Diplomacy +15, Fly +27, Heal +16, Intimidate +27, Knowledge (arcana) +15, Knowledge (history) +27, Knowledge (nobility) +15, Knowledge (planes) +27, Knowledge (religion) +27, Perception +28, Sense Motive +28, Spellcraft +24, Swim +25", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "13", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any good-aligned plane", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "lay on hands (15/day, 9d6 hit points, as an 18th-level paladin)", "Saves": "Fort +17, Ref +16, Will +13; +4 vs. poison, +4 resistance vs. evil", "Melee": "+2 longsword +25/+20/+15/+10 (2d6+9), +2 axiomatic holy spiked heavy steel shield +27 (2d6+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft., fly 150 ft.
