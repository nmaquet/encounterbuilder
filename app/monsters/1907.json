This attack instead harms the infested creature-the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the incoming attack so that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The mindslaver mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved but before damage is rolled. </h5><h5><b>Infestation (Su)</b> A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host, the mold shares the same 5-foot-square with its host's space; this does not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the host takes a -4 penalty on all Will saves made against the mindslaver mold's <i>dominate person</i> spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free of a host with a DC 15 Strength check as a standard action-doing so deals 2d6 points of damage as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no damage when it is so removed. </h5><h5><b>Mold Mindlink (Su)</b> A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other mindslaver mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver molds in this area as if it had a <i>status</i> spell in effect on all other molds. </h5><h5><b>Spore Pod (Ex)</b> A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod the size of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack that has a range increment of 20 feet. </h5><h5><b>Spores (Su)</b> Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the mold with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1d4 points of Wisdom damage as the mold's spores swiftly drain away the victim's willpower and sense of self. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Mindslaver mold is a much-feared infestation from the First World that is particularly common in Grungir Forest, as well as on the island of Kalva, where the cannibals respect and fear the mold almost as a manifestation of some strange god. The mold itself shares a single consciousness, although individual patches of the stuff retain their own goals. Mindslaver mold seeks humanoid hosts, parasitizing them even as it manipulates them into serving as its bodyguards and protectors.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Common, Sylvan (cannot speak); mold mindlink", "Source": "Lands Of The Linnorm Kings", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or infestation (2-10)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(4d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 2, Dex 17, Con 17, Int 14, Wis 12, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "spore pod +7 touch (spores)", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1907, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Initiative", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 15, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mindslaver Mold", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +8, Escape Artist +7, Perception +8, Stealth +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +4, Will +2", "Melee": "", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., climb 5 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Small"}
