This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does.</h5><h5><b> Freezing Fog (Sp)</b> An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. </h5><h5><b>Ice Shape (Su)</b> A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.</h5><h5><b> Ice Tomb (Sp)</b> A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5><h5><b> Icewalking (Ex)</b> This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.</h5><h5><b> Snow Vision (Ex)</b> A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Although most consider it to be the weakest and most feral of the chromatic dragons, the white dragon makes up for its lack of cunning with sheer ferocity. White dragons dwell on remote, frozen mountaintops and in arctic lowlands, making their home in glittering caves full of ice and snow. They prefer their meals completely frozen.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Giant, Orc", "Source": "d20pfsrd", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "15", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(25d12+200)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 37, Dex 8, Con 27, Int 18, Wis 21, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "15 ft.
