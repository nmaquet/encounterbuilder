Believed to have once been a just and kind race that became corrupted by magic, scorpionfolk are feared and avoided by most intelligent desert-traveling races. Most scorpionfolk tribes tend to be nomadic and move around frequently, only settling in one place until the food source runs out. These tribes use tents for shelter and care little for any belongings other than what they can carry. Some few tribes settle in an area and construct small towns and villages of hardened mud, rock, and occasionally limestone. These tribes tend to be slightly more civilized than the nomadic scorpionfolk, and are often looked upon with disdain by their nomadic brothers. Larger tribes, both nomadic and settled, often have a shaman (a cleric or sorcerer of 5th-8th level) in their midst. These shamans tend to the sick and injured and sometimes take part in raids or excursions by the scorpionfolk. Tribal leaders are fighters or barbarians of 6th-9th level. Scorpionfolk stand just over 6 feet tall and are over 10 feet long from head to the base of the tail. Tails range from 8 to 10 feet long. Scorpionfolk, on average, weigh around 2,000 pounds. Their skin is usually bronze, brown, or black, and the lower scorpion torso dark tan or the color of dark sand. Hair color varies, with most males shaving their heads and females wearing their hair long in tightly knotted ponytails. Scorpionfolk prefer to attack with weapons and a tail sting, only resorting to their clawed hands if necessary. Favored weapons of these creatures include falchions, spears, scimitars, and shortbows.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Sadara", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), band (6-10 plus 1-4 medium scorpions), troop (11-20 plus 2-8 medium scorpions and 1 giant scorpion), or tribe (20-40 plus 8-16 medium scorpions and 2-4 giant scorpions)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+21)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 12, Con 16, Int 8, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "mwk composite shortbow +8/+3 (1d8+4)", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5048, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Climb, +4 Perception", "AC": "16, touch 10, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Scorpionfolk", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +8, Diplomacy +6, Intimidate +9, Perception +14, Sense Motive +6, Stealth +4, Survival +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm deserts", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +9", "Melee": "mwk falchion +11/+6 (2d6+6), sting +5 (1d6+2 plus poison) or 2 claws +10 (1d6+4), sting +10 (1d6+2 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Large"}
