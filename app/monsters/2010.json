Most often formed from the souls of evil creatures killed by family or friends, vulnudaemons spread their insanity throughout the worlds by deceiving and killing all creatures they meet. Vulnudaemons stalk their prey, infecting them with a sense of impending doom and watching their reactions, learning their responses before attacking and savoring their death. These daemons serve as excellent assassins, hiding in the shadows before debilitating their enemies, or striking from the protection of <i>invisibility</i> in order to deliver the killing blow. When facing stronger enemies, vulnudaemons seek to wear them down through a series of attacks, nicking at them and darting off, then repeating the process until their opponents bleed out. Vulnudaemons often find themselves called to the Material Plane by cultists of deities associated with murder and assassination. These cultists often see vulnudaemons as sacred creatures favored by their deity, and rather than simply use the daemons as assassins, cultists often grant them a shocking degree of freedom to wander the region as they will, picking victims to fit their own agendas and murdering whomever they wish. Cultists who conjure vulnudaemons into the world usually take care to show the daemons a secret hand sign or other code that members of the cult can show them, lest the monsters decide to target one of the believers for an attack. Whether or not an accidentally targeted cultist has the time to flash her safety sign to the daemon should the creature attack her at a later date is, of course, another matter. Vulnudaemons stand 3 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Draconic, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 3", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or murder (3-12)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2010, "SubType": "(daemon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (aura of doom), Combat Casting, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 14, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Vulnudaemon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +12, Diplomacy +10, Fly +11, Knowledge (arcana) +7, Knowledge (planes) +8, Perception +10, Sense Motive +10, Spellcraft +8, Stealth +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abaddon)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +5, Will +6", "Melee": "short sword +10/+5 (1d4+2/19-20 plus bleed), bite +5 (1d3+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Small"}
