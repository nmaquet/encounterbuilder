All creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. </h5><h5><b>Manipulate Flames (Su)</b> A wyrm red dragon can control any fire spell within 110 feet of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires. </h5><h5><b>Melt Stone (Su)</b> The dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 55-foot-radius area. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Few creatures inspire such dread as the magnificently wrathful red dragons, and the ones with mythic power are even more <i>fear</i>ful. They are the embodiments of destruction, hatred, and draconic arrogance. Magnificent and utterly frightening to behold, mythic red dragons possess a fierce beauty that exceeds all other dragons. From their powerful jaws, capable of snapping iron bars and the masts of ships, to their muscular tails, which can crash through stone walls as easily as whips break skin, red dragons reflect predatory superiority and murderous perfection. A mythic red dragon's body has cordlike muscles that allow it to move more quickly and gracefully than a creature of its size should have a right to. Villains of the worst kind, mythic red dragons are unf linchingly evil in ways rarely matched even by other mythic evil creatures. Their destructive impulses and wrathful fiery rampages surprise and delight the most heinous demons. These legendary dragons demand annual royal sacrifices or tribute in slaves, and think nothing of working their underlings to death. An older mythic red dragon spends little time out of its lair, and when it does emerge it prefers to attack humanoid settlements away from the immediate vicinity, burning down buildings, dropping peasants from great heights, and demanding coins and other treasures. This raiding pattern makes it difficult for would-be dragonslayers to find the creature's actual lair. Mythic red dragons use their magic to protect their lairs with a variety of protective spells. A typical lair also contains slave-built mundane traps, environmental hazards such as steam vents poisonous fumes, and (if within an active volcano) molten rock as part of its defenses.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Giant, Orc", "Source": "Mythic Adventures", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "13", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(27d12+343)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 45, Dex 6, Con 29, Int 20, Wis 21, Cha 24", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "15 ft.
