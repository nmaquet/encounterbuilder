Its lower body is that of a great golden lion and its upper body is a coal-black humanoid with glaring crimson eyes. Its mane-like hair is thick, long, and dark brown, and the creature wears it draped over its broad shoulders and down its massive back. Its mouth is lined with sharpened fangs and its arms end in large, powerful hands. Splatters of dried and caked blood can be seen in the creature's mane and fur.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Gorson</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 22</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>615,000</h5><h5>LE Large outsider (devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+13; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>see invisibility</i>, see in darkness; Perception +33</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>44, touch 26, flat-footed 35 (+9 Dex, +18 natural, -1 size, +8 profane)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>372 (24d10+240); regeneration 10 (good, silver)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+18, <b>Ref </b>+23, <b>Will </b>+20</h5><h5><b>DR </b>15/good and silver; <b>Immune </b>fire, poison; <b>Resist </b>acid 10, cold 10; <b>SR </b>33</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>50 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b><i><i>+3 wounding battleaxe</i></i> +39/+34/+29/+24 (2d6+15/19- 20/x3 plus 1 bleed), 2 forepaws +30 (2d8+6 plus grab)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>10 ft.; <b>Reach </b>10 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>pounce, rake (2 forepaws, 2d8+18)</h5><h5><b>Spell-Like Abilities</b> (CL 20th)</br>Constant&mdash;<i>detect good</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>see invisibility</i></br>At Will&mdash;<i>animate dead</i>, <i>blasphemy</i> (DC 25), <i>charm monster</i> (DC 22), <i>create undead</i>, <i>desecrate</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>lightning bolt</i> (DC 21), <i>magic circle against good</i>, <i>produce flame</i>, <i>suggestion</i> (DC 21), <i>tongues</i>, <i>unhallow</i> (DC 23), <i>unholy aura</i> (DC 26), <i>wall of fire</i></br>2/day&mdash;summon (level 9, 2d10 lemures or nupperibos, 2d4 bearded devils, 1d4 bone devils, erinyes, or barbed devils, or 1 pit fiend 100%)</br>1/day&mdash;<i>symbol of stunning</i> (DC 25)</h5></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>35, <b>Dex </b>29, <b>Con </b>30, <b>Int </b> 23, <b>Wis </b>23, <b>Cha </b>27</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+24; <b>CMB </b>+37 (+41 grapple); <b>CMD </b>64 (68 vs. trip)</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Cleave, Critical Focus, Great Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Overrun, Improved Critical (battleaxe), Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Improved Vital Strike, Power Attack, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (battleaxe)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Acrobatics +36, Bluff +35, Diplomacy +35, Escape Artist +33, Intimidate +35, Knowledge (local) +30, Knowledge (nature) +30, Knowledge (planes) +33, Knowledge (religion) +30, Perception +33, Sense Motive +33, Survival +33</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.</h5><h5><b>Combat Gear </b><i>+3 wounding battleaxe</i></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any (Hell)</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary or troupe (Gorson plus 1-3 barbed devils, bone devils or bearded devils, and 4-10 nupperibos)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>double standard</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The Blood Duke, Gorson, is a great lion-bodied humanoid that serves Great Mammon as 2nd general of his infernal army. Gorson leads 5 legions of barbed devils in service to his lord. Gorson is called \"The Lion\" for his ferocity in battle and his general appearance. He often takes the entrails of those he has slain and makes a necklace, wrapping it around his neck or entwining them in his bloody mane-like hair.</p><p>Gorson stands 8 feet tall and is 12 feet long. He weighs 1,200 pounds.</p><p>Gorson usually begins combat by leaping on a foe and rending it to pieces with his forepaws and rear claws. Those that survive this onslaught are subjected to a massive assault by his great battleaxe. Gorson attacks relentlessly and only stops when all foes are dead. Those that attempt to flee are run down and slaughtered.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Gorson plus 1-3 barbed devils, bone devils or bearded devils, and 4-10 nupperibos)", "Ref": "23", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(24d10+240)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 35, Dex 29, Con 30, Int 23, Wis 23, Cha 27", "Gear": "+3 wounding battleaxe", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2512, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Critical Focus, Great Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Overrun, Improved Critical (battleaxe), Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Improved Vital Strike, Power Attack, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (battleaxe)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "18", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "44, touch 26, flat-footed 35", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gorson", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +36, Bluff +35, Diplomacy +35, Escape Artist +33, Intimidate +35, Knowledge (local) +30, Knowledge (nature) +30, Knowledge (planes) +33, Knowledge (religion) +30, Perception +33, Sense Motive +33, Survival +33", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "20", "Race": "", "CR": "22", "XP": 615000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Hell)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +18, Ref +23, Will +20", "Melee": "+3 wounding battleaxe +39/+34/+29/+24 (2d6+15/19- 20/x3 plus 1 bleed), 2 forepaws +30 (2d8+6 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Large"}
