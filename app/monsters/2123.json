When flying, a leaf leshy must end its movement at least 5 feet lower in elevation than it started. </h5><h5><b>Seedpods (Ex)</b> Leaf leshys sprout explosive acorns, pine cones, or other seedpods, and can hurl these as ranged attacks. A seedpod has a range increment of 10 feet and detonates on contact to deal 1 point of bludgeoning damage (this damage is not modified by Strength). Anyone struck by a seedpod must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Leaf leshys tend to the well-being of <i>tree</i>s, whether natural stands or cultivated orchards. In appearance, they have soft, pulpy-looking bodies and wear clothing made of dozens of leaves. Larger leaves cover their shoulders, often giving them the appearance of wearing cloaks, and most adorn their relatively featureless heads with helmets made from pine cones, nuts, or fruit rinds. This leafy layer of clothing functions as masterwork padded armor for a leaf leshy, but not for any other creature. Leaf leshys love to play at war. When not laboring on their <i>tree</i>s, they wheedle any companions to engage in mock duels with their twig spears, resorting to private weapon drills when they must. In actual battle, they are much more cautious, sticking to cover and harrying their foes with hit-and-run tactics, as they have a strongly developed sense of self-preservation. <br><b>GROWING A LEAF LESHY </b></br> Leaf leshys are usually grown under the shade of fruit or nut <i>tree</i>s. To grow a leaf leshy, the maker plants an acorn and pine cone together, then mounds up leaves, sticks, and needles around them. When first born, a leaf leshy has no armor, leafy cape, or weapon, but can construct them from available materials given a day and left to its own devices (no Craft check required). </h5><h5><b>LEAF LESHY </b> </h5><h5><b>CL </b>5th; </h5><h5><b>Price </b>1,000 gp </h5><h5><b>RITUAL </b> </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, <i>magic stone</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>summon nature's ally I</i>; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Knowledge (nature) DC 12; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>500 gp</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Druidic, Sylvan; plantspeech (trees)", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 3", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or grove (2-16)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(1d8+1)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 6, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "seedpods +2 touch (1 plus deafen)", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2123, "SubType": "(leshy, shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth and Survival in forests and jungles", "AC": "13, touch 12, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Leaf Leshy", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly -1, Stealth +5 (+9 in forests and jungles), Survival +1 (+5 in forests and jungles)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "1/2", "XP": 200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any forest or hill", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "change shape (Small tree; tree shape), verdant burst", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +1, Will +1", "Melee": "shortspear +2 (1d4-2/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., climb 10 ft., fly 10 ft.
