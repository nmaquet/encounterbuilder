They are the daughters of the god Phorcys and the goddess Ceto. Euryale and Sthenno were born immortal and are hideous creatures with writing snakes for hair, brass claws, wings, and a gaze that can turn any living creature into stone. Phorcys tasked them with guarding the entrance to the Underworld.</p><p>Medusa was born mortal and was very beautiful. Phorcys sent her to the Material Plane so all could gaze upon the beauty of his daughter.</p><p>Medusa's beauty rivaled that of some of the goddesses, and some of them grew jealous of Medusa, particularly the goddess Athena. Her beauty also turned the heads of some of the gods, and when Poseidon seduced her in a temple to Athena, the goddess became enraged and changed the beautiful Medusa into a creature as hideous as her sisters. Poseidon turned from his love, never to return again. Medusa, enraged, fled into the desert and never came back to civilization.</p><p>The hero Perseus was tasked with killing the gorgon known as Medusa and bringing her head to King Polydectes as a wedding present. Using a magic shield given to him by the gods, he avoided Medusa's deadly gaze and severed her head. From her serpentine body sprang the children of Poseidon, creatures similar in appearance to their mother. These creatures escaped into the world and are called medusa.</p><p>Sthenno and Euryale long for their sister's return or their meeting with her in the Underworld. Yet being immortal, they cannot enter the Realm of the Dead. Thus, both know they will never see their beloved sibling again. Their cries are said to be audible on the wind as a high-pitched shrill akin to a bird's cry.</p><p>Both Sthenno and Euryale are 10 feet tall and weigh around 600 pounds or more. Sthenno's eyes are blue; Euryale's eyes are copper.</p><p>Sthenno and Euryale rarely enter combat unless pressed or provoked.</p><p>They are both deadly combatants and use their claws, bite, snakes, and petrifying gaze with precision force. Sthenno enjoys \"collecting\" those she has turned to stone and even has a room in her lair where she displays them. Euryale simply smashes to rubble those she has petrified.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair (Sthenno and Euryale), or troupe (true gorgon plus 2-8 medusa and 1-4 greater medusa)", "Ref": "17", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(20d10+160)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 35, Dex 17, Con 26, Int 24, Wis 24, Cha 28", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2660, "SubType": "(evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Multiattack, Power Attack, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (bite) Weapon Focus (claw), Weapon Focus (snake bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "41, touch 12, flat-footed 38", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Euryale", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +26, Bluff +32, Craft (alchemy) +30, Diplomacy +32, Fly +20, Intimidate +32, Knowledge (arcana) +30, Knowledge (dungeoneering) +27, Knowledge (planes) +30, Perception +30, Sense Motive +30, Stealth +22, Survival +27", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "19", "Race": "", "CR": "22", "XP": 615000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Outer Planes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "immortal Languages Abyssal, Aklo, Common, Draconic, Infernal, Terran (Euryale only), Undercommon", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +17, Will +19", "Melee": "2 claws +32 (2d6+12 plus grab), bite +32 (1d10+12), snake bite +30 (1d8+6 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 50 ft.
