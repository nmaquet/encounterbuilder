In human form, the Mouse Lord cannot use her natural weapons or disease special attack but can wield weapons and wear armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Mouse Lord retains her movement modes (and speeds) in human form. </h5><h5><b>Disease (Ex)</b>: <i>Black fever</i>-bite, save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day; damage 1d4 Dex, 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. The Mouse Lord can suppress her ability to cause disease (as a free action) if she so wishes. </h5><h5><b>Immortality (Su)</b> The Mouse Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Mouse Lord's soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within one week, it inhabits another mouse or rat on the Material Plane and the Mouse Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap her soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Mouse Lord, one must destroy every mouse and rat in existence (so her soul has no creature to inhabit). </h5><h5><b>Keen Senses (Ex)</b>: The Mouse Lord sees four times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light. </h5><h5><b>Rodent Passivism (Ex)</b>: Rodents (including dire versions) do not willingly attack the Mouse Lord, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the Mouse Lord attacks a rodent, its protection against that creature ends.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Like the Cat Lord, there is only one Mouse Lord. And she is the Lord (or Lady) of all rodents. Her natural form is that of a large black-furred dire rat with copper eyes. She can assume a human form and this form is almost always of a female with darkened skin, raven-black hair, and copper eyes. She dresses in robes of flowing silver or gray.</p><p>The Mouse Lord spends her days roaming the Material Plane, Astral Plane, and Ethereal Plane.</p><p>The Mouse Lord enters combat using her bite. Most often she enters battle with <i>greater magic fang</i> already affecting her. When enough foes are within range, she unleashes her <i>confusion</i> ability and usually <i>displaces</i> on her next turn. If combat goes against her, she summons other rodents to aid her or to cover her escape.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Druidic, Elven, Goblin, Gnome, Halfling, Sylvan; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Mouse Lord plus 2-12 rat swarms or 10-20 dire rats)", "Ref": "18", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(15d10+60)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 25, Con 18, Int 20, Wis 18, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1857, "SubType": "(native, shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Acrobatic, Alertness, Athletic, Blind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics, +4 Stealth", "AC": "29, touch 21, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mouse Lord", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +34, Climb +31, Diplomacy +19, Escape Artist +22, Handle Animal +19, Knowledge (nature) +20, Perception +26, Sense Motive +26, Stealth +29, Survival +19, Swim +23", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "change shape (human or mouse, polymorph)", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +18, Will +9", "Melee": "bite +22 (2d6+6 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
