When the Great Uprising that pitted Lucifer and his minions against Asmodeus and his minions occurred, Lilith sided with Lucifer. When Moloch heard of her betrayal he raged against her, nearly killing her. If not for the swift action of several of her lilins (who sacrificed themselves for her), she would have surely been killed. During the commotion and chaos, she was spirited away to a safe location by Xaphan.</p><p>When Lucifer constructed the plane of Infernus, Lilith had found her new home. She became a member of Lucifer's court and serves as one of his concubines and chief officers (ruling and commanding several companies of lilins). Lucifer, as of late has taken a special interest in her and rumors abound that should he take a queen to rule beside him it will be Lilith. This has infuriated more than one of his consorts, especially Demoriel who jealously wants the throne of Infernus and Lucifer all to herself. Lilith knows of Demoriel's jealousy and always keeps an open eye on her (including planting several spies in Demoriel's camp).</p><p>Lilith appears as an insanely comely female standing 5'7\" tall and weighing roughly 130 pounds. Her skin is cinnamon colored and her hair, waist length and blood red. Her eyes are emerald green and sparkle under the fiery skies of Infernus. Her hands end in claws and underneath her thick hair she hides two tiny dark black horns. She has a small pair of leathery black bat-like wings that she can fold against her back and hide under her robes at a moment's notice should the need for such deception arise.</p><p>\"\u2026and thus, Lucifer created Infernus, a plane of eternal and everlasting fire and suffering: one plane, one ruler; created by his own hands, his own blood, and a portion of his very essence.</p><p>From his great keep, <i>Malefacta</i>, Lucifer waits for the day he can challenge for the Throne of Hell again.\" - <i>translated from the \u2018Infernal Grimoire</i>: <i>The Politics of Hell' Lilith begins combat by peppering her foes with her spell-like abilities</i>.</p><p>When combat begins, Lilith usually hits the closest opponents (she deems most susceptible) with her <i>mass hold monster</i> ability. Next she unleashes a <i>fireball</i> hoping to engulf as many opponents as possible. She then charges in with her longsword, peppering her foes with <i>lightning bolt</i>s and <i>fireball</i>s. If she has time before battle begins, she uses her <i>magic circle against good</i> and her <i>unholy aura</i> on herself. Any foes slain in combat are subjected to her <i>animate dead</i> spell-like ability. Against powerful foes she summons other devils to fight with her.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Infernal, Terran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or entourage (Lilith plus 2-4 erinyes or lilins)", "Ref": "13", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(17d10+85)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 16, Con 21, Int 19, Wis 19, Cha 33", "Gear": "Amaheuris", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2514, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Combat Casting, Deceitful, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Persuasive, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (fireball), Power Attack, Weapon Focus (longsword)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "33, touch 24, flat-footed 30", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lilith", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +23, Bluff +35, Diplomacy +32, Disguise +35, Fly +27, Intimidate +35, Knowledge (planes) +24, Knowledge (religion) +24, Perception +28, Sense Motive +28", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "16", "Race": "", "CR": "16", "XP": 76800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Infernus)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +13, Will +16", "Melee": "+2 axiomatic unholy longsword +25/+20/+15/+10 (1d8+7/19-20) or 2 claws +22 (1d6+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
