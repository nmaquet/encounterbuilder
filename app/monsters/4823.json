Living creatures within range take damage (damage is detailed with each elemental) each round they remain in the area. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. This effect is especially devastating to plants, animals, and aquatic creatures, which take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Earth Mastery (Ex)</b> A salt elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) </h5><h5><b>Salt Poisoning (Ex)</b> Anyone hit by a salt elemental's claw attack is sickened for 3 rounds + 1 round per Hit Dice of the salt elemental. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Water (Ex)</b> A salt elemental submerged in water that covers at least half its body takes 1d6 points of damage each round until it escapes. Damage from water-based attacks (such as the slam attack of a water elemental) deal +50% damage to a salt elemental.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Salt elementals inhabit regions rich in salt upon the Plane of Earth. Some believe they originated on a pocket plane somewhere near the energy planes and Plane of Water; perhaps an Elemental Plane of Salt. Salt elementals, avoid large expanses of water at all costs, knowing exposure to such a large quantity spells disaster. Salt elementals spend most of their time wandering their realm and often make forays into other planes (except the Plane of Water), seeking creatures on which to feed. They are particularly fond of plants, which are extremely vulnerable to their dehydrating ability. A salt elemental generally appears as a humanoid with no discernible features, though they can take other forms, and some do, preferring to appear in the shape of large animals or giant vermin (usually beetles).</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Terran", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-8)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 10, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4823, "SubType": "(earth, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, DodgeB, Endurance, Great Cleave, Mobility, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 9, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Huge Salt Elemental", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +16, Knowledge (dungeoneering) +5, Knowledge (planes) +5, Perception +11, Stealth +3", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Earth)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +2, Will +6", "Melee": "2 claws +11 (2d6+5 plus salt poisoning)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
