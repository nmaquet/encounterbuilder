Creatures attacking the frost drakeling with natural weapons or touching the frost drakeling take 1d4 points of cold damage each round of contact. </h5><h5><b>Icewalking (Ex)</b> This ability works like <i>spider climb</i>, but the surfaces the frost drakeling climbs must be icy. It can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. </h5><h5><b>Icy Breath (Su)</b> A frost drakeling can, as a standard action, spit a line of freezing ice to a range of 20 feet. A creature struck takes 3d6 points of cold damage (DC 13 Reflex half). Further, a creature that fails its save is <i>slow</i>ed (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 1d4 rounds. Once a frost drakeling uses its icy breath, it cannot use it again for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Frost drakelings are, like their counterparts the flame drakelings, believed to be related to or an offshoot of dragons or drakes (in this case white dragons or frost drakes). As with the flame drakelings however, scholars find nothing linking the races together. Frost drakelings are diurnal hunters and feed upon small game found in their artic territories. Frost drakelings hunts are known to span several miles from their lair, especially if tracking game. Prey is killed and dragged back to their lair (usually a frigid cave complex set into the side of a mountain out of reach of other predators). Frost drakelings are about 18 inches long and weigh 50 pounds. Their scales are dull blue with some frost drakelings having white blotches on their bodies. Wings are long and thin and usually icy blue in color. Eyes are deep, rich blue in color. Frost drakelings mate for life and when reproducing, the female lays a small clutch of one to three eggs. Eggs are small, frail, and sapphire blue in color, resembling large gemstones. The eggs hatch within 6 months, and young reach maturity within 2 years. Frost drakelings live up to 120 years on average. Frost drakelings, unlike other drakelings, do not shy away from combat. When confronted, the creature unleashes its frigid breath weapon and swoops in to attack with its bite.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or band (2-4)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d12+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 8, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 6, Wis 13, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4808, "SubType": "(cold)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 15, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Frost Drakeling", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +4, Fly +8, Intimidate +4, Perception +7, Stealth +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold hills and mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "icewalking", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +8 (1d6-1 plus 1d4 cold)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., burrow 20 ft., fly 40 ft.
