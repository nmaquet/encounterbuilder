Though rarely encountered on other planes, they do enjoy traveling to the Material Plane from time to time, journeying to the plane via lightning storms and riding the lightning bolts to the ground. On the Material Plane, voltars make their lairs near civilized areas, but not close enough to draw attention to them. Most such lairs consist of well-hidden and camouflaged caves or caverns in dense forests or hilly areas. They enjoy watching natives of the Material Plane and often make forays into nearby civilized areas to observe the locals. Voltars are nocturnal hunters, preferring to hunt during thunderstorms, rainstorms, and especially lightning storms. A voltar's diet consists primarily of whatever it can catch and kill supplemented with a mix of berries, nuts, and fruits. A voltar appears as a milky-white slender and lithe humanoid standing about 6-1/2 feet tall. Its body, armor, and weapon is covered in dancing and arcing crackling electricity of blue and white. Its eyes are white and empty (save for the small sparks of electricity that seem to play in them). Its head is long and rectangular and its mouth long and wide. No teeth seem to be present in its mouth. A voltar speaks its own tongue consisting of clicks and guttural sounds. It seems to understand Common, but does not appear to be able to speak it. A lone voltar does not attack if outnumbered (unless it is cornered and cannot escape). When more than one voltar is present, however, they often attack creatures that wander too close to their lair. In combat, a voltar attacks with its electrically-charged fists, weapon, or by hurling a bolt of lightning at an opponent.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (can't speak), Voltar", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "lightning bolt +7 (2d6 electricity)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5094, "SubType": "(electricity, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (death throes), Iron Will, Weapon Focus (longsword)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 12, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Voltar", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Diplomacy +5, Escape Artist +7, Knowledge (planes) +8, Perception +8, Stealth +10, Survival +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +6, Will +3", "Melee": "longsword +9 (1d8+3 plus 1d6 electricity), 2 slams +3 (1d4+3 plus 1d6 electricity)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
