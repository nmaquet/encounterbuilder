Creatures with 5 HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for 1d6+6 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same spider lich's aura for one day. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. </h5><h5><b>Paralyzing Bite (Su)</b> Any living creature a spider lich hits with its bite attack must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6+12 minutes. <i>Remove paralysis</i> or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the <i>bestow curse</i> spell description). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a spider lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> DC 21 Fort; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6/rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Strength damage; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>. The save is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. </h5><h5><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> When a spider lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden by the spider lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell) immediately begins to rebuild the undead spider lich's body nearby. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew. </h5><h5><b>Spells</b> A spider lich does not require any verbal, somatic, or material components to cast its spells.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The true origin of the spider lich is shrouded in mystery. Scholars argue constantly about its origins and how it came into existence. Some stand by the theory that intelligent giant spiders, perhaps phase spiders or some offshoot race of that dreaded creature, discovered the path to lichdom. Others contend a spider lich is the byproduct of a failed sorcerer's attempt at lichdom. Still others argue that the spider lich is simply a spellcaster's chosen form once it achieved lichhood. Whatever its true origins, the spider lich is truly a dreaded creature that many adventurers hope they never run across. Spider liches are most often encountered underground in dungeons, caves, and crypts or in ruined temples and shrines, leading to further speculation among scholars as to the creature's origins. They do not associate with true spiders but are often encountered with other undead, particularly wraiths and spectres. Spider liches have an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Countless days, months, years are spent pouring over ancient texts and tomes. Though evil by nature, spider liches often work with other creatures, particularly evil spellcasters to quench their thirst for this knowledge. Spider liches stand over 8 feet tall and resemble skeletal spiders. Their eight eyes are deep black in color. Other than the sound of their bony legs clattering across stone floors, these creatures make no sound. They can speak a variety of languages but rarely do so. <br><b>The Spider Lich's Phylactery</b><br> An integral part of becoming a spider lich is the creation of the phylactery in which the creature stores its spirit. The only way to get rid of a spider lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. Unless its phylactery is located and destroyed, a spider lich can rejuvenate after it is killed. The typical spider lich phylactery is a gemstone of not less than 1,000 gp value. The spider lich hides the gemstone in a safe place and wraps it securely in a complex mesh of super strong webbing (DR 10/-, 24 hp).</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Undercommon, plus two others", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troop (1 spider lich plus 2-4 wraiths or spectres)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(12d8+48)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 17, Con -, Int 16, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5070, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Combat Casting, Defensive Combat Training, Empower Spell, Toughness, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics, +4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "19, touch 12, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Spider Lich", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +11, Climb +25, Intimidate +18, Knowledge (arcana) +18, Knowledge (planes) +9, Perception +21, Sense Motive +11, Spellcraft +18, Stealth +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "rejuvenation", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +7, Will +10", "Melee": "bite +11 (2d8+3 plus paralysis and poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., climb 40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
