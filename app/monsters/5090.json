Legends say the uggoth race was formed when a band of ancient humans offended their gods and were forever cursed. Scholars cannot verify or disprove this origin myth. Uggoths dwell in great underground cities, most of which are built and maintained by slave labor. Once an ambitious race with desires to rule both underground and aboveground, uggoths now spend most of their time lounging in their homes or in public places within the uggoth cities partaking of various dream-inducing narcotics. They are still very active in trade, usually trading with other evil-aligned subterranean races. In exchange for various foods, manufactured weapons, and spices, the uggoth receive slaves, exotic herbs, and the like. Uggoths stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh 160 to 180 pounds. Their humanoid flesh is dark amber and leathery to the touch. Their lower torsos are even darker amber fading to black near the tips of the tentacles. Uggoths live for 150 years typically. A uggoth attack with its mind thrust attack in an effort to dispatch its enemies as quickly and efficiently as possible. Creatures that survive are attacked with various spell-like abilities and slashed or grabbed by the creature's tentacles. Opponents that are killed are usually devoured on the spot or carried back to the uggoth's dwelling and eaten later or fed to the young. Opponents that show promise as slaves are captured instead of killed. Potential slaves are carted back to the uggoth's city and placed in a public slave pen where they are eventually sold to the highest bidder. Occasionally the city's overseer allows the uggoth to keep captured slaves.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common, Draconic, Undercommon", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d8+27)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 19, Wis 19, Cha 21", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5090, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Casting, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "22, touch 13, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Uggoth", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +14, Diplomacy +14, Intimidate +17, Knowledge (any one) +13, Knowledge (arcana) +16, Perception +16, Sense Motive +13, Spellcraft +12, Swim +12, Use Magical Device +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "12", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "water breathing", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +7, Will +12", "Melee": "2 claws +10 (1d4+4), 4 tentacles +10 (1d6+4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
