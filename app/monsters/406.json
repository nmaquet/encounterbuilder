Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves. </h5><h5><b>Preserve Memory (Su)</b> Any sentient creature with a Charisma of 14 or higher can copy one of its memories into a stone idol. To do so, the creature must remain in contact with a stone idol for 1 minute and concentrate on a memory to be duplicated. This memory must be 5 minutes or shorter and be of an actual event; imaginings cannot be reproduced. After a memory has been duplicated, it remains in the stone idol until a new memory is recorded. A memory held by a stone idol can be altered via the spell modify memory. A memory held within a stone idol can be viewed by any creature that comes into mental contact with the construct and by the use of detect thoughts, mind-reading effects, or similar abilities, even one redirected by its stony mind ability. </h5><h5><b>Share Abilities (Su)</b> An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*). </h5><h5><b>Skills</b> In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies. </h5><h5><b>Stony Mind (Su)</b> Any divination spell targeting a creature or object within 30 feet of a stone idol instead targets the construct. Thus, for the purposes of any spell that reveals auras, those affected are treated as being under the effects of the spell misdirection, while spells like detect thoughts receive nothing more than vague impressions. Should detect thoughts or another mind-reading effect target a stone idol that contains a memory, the ability user instantly gains the memory held within. </h5><h5><b>Suggestive (Su)</b> Those fascinated by a stone idol's animal trance or hypnotic pattern spell-like ability become highly susceptible to the suggestions of others nearby. Any creature can make a suggestion (as per the spell suggestion) to a fascinated creature, who must then make a DC 15 Will save or proceed to follow the suggestion. Any creature who makes a suggestion is understood by the fascinated creature, as per the spell tongues or speak with animals. A suggestion lasts for 1 hour, even if a creature is no longer being fascinated. A fascinated creature follows only the first suggestion it fails its saving throw against and no additional suggestions. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Rarely seen in civilized lands, stone idols rest among the ruins of ancient civilizations, the sole inheritors of incredible secrets and lost lore.
