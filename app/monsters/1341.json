All of a sceaduinar's natural attacks deal +1d6 points of negative energy damage to the target. This energy does not heal creatures healed by <i>inflict</i> spells. </h5><h5><b>Void Child (Ex)</b> Sceaduinars are immune to effects that target souls (such as <i>trap the</i> soul) or require knowledge of a creature's identity (such as scrying). When one is slain, it cannot be restored to life by magic save by a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>, or by divine intervention.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Sceaduinars are strange creatures born of pure entropy, the antithesis of creation and life. In the cold heart of the Negative Energy Plane, the un-substance of that realm coalesces into snowf lake-like crystals, and it is from these strange formations that sceaduinars arise, breaking free from their jagged \"eggs\" fully grown. They hate the living and the undead with equal passion, perhaps out of jealousy for those who have a spark of life (even if that spark is provided by a corruption of life in the form of undeath), though they usually ignore creatures from the Outer Sphere. They believe their positive energy counterparts, the jyoti, long ago stole their ability to create, breaking the parallel between the two energy planes and forcing these void-dwellers into an unwanted role of pure destruction. In a way, their hatred parallels that of another native of the Negative Energy Plane-the nightshade. Yet despite their similar goals, the sceaduinars see nightshades as just another corruption of life worthy of destruction- even though very few sceaduinars are powerful enough to directly oppose one of these deadly undead. Sceaduinars are quite intelligent, yet they have no real society to speak of. When they gather together, it is always to form a larger band to strike against a particularly dangerous foe.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Common", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or death squad (2-11)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+36)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 20, Con 18, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1341, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Mobility, Skill Focus (Perception), Step Up, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Knowledge (planes), +8 Stealth", "AC": "20, touch 16, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sceaduinar", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Escape Artist +17, Fly +9, Intimidate +15, Knowledge (nature) +13, Knowledge (planes) +17, Perception +17, Sense Motive +14, Stealth +25", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Negative Energy Plane)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +11, Will +5", "Melee": "bite +14 (1d6+3 plus 1d6 negative energy and energy drain), 2 wings +9 (1d6+1 plus 1d6 negative energy)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 90 ft.
