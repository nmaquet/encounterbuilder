Certain demons and humanoid cultists are fond of using plagued beast horses as mounts. <br><b>Creating a Plagued Beast</b><br> \"Plagued Beast\" is an acquired template that can be added to a living, corporeal creature with an Int score of 1 or 2. A plagued beast uses all of the creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. <br><b>CR:</b> As base creature +1. <br><b>Alignment:</b> Neutral evil. <br><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes and subtypes indicating kind. Do not recalculate saves, BAB, or skill ranks. <br><b>Armor Class:</b> Increase from the base creature by +2. <br><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all of the creature's racial HD to d8s. As undead, plagued beasts use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). <br><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> Plagued beasts gain darkvision 60 feet and channel resistance +2. A plagued beast also gains damage reduction 5/slashing. They are immune to cold, and gain all of the standard undead traits. <br><b>Melee:</b> A plagued beast gains a bite attack that deals damage based on the plagued beast's size. If the beast already has a bite attack, the bite's damage increases by one step, as if it had increased one size category. <br><b>Special Attacks:</b> A plagued beast inflicts demonplague (see page 29) with each successful bite attack. The save DC to resist the disease is equal to 10 + the plagued beast's HD + 1/2 the plagued beast's Charisma modifier. <br><b>Abilities:</b> +4 Str, +2 Dex. A plagued beast has a minimum Charisma score of 15-if the base creature's Charisma is lower, increase it to 15. If it's 15 or higher, do not adjust the plagued beast's final Charisma. A plagued beast has no Constitution score; as an undead, it uses its Charisma in place of Constitution when calculating hit points, Fortitude saves, or any special ability that relies on Constitution. <br><b>Feats:</b> A plagued beast gains Toughness as a bonus feat.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "The Worldwound", "Land": "1", "Organization": "?", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8+7)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 16, Con -, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4676, "SubType": "(augmented animal)", "MonsterSource": "Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 177", "Feats": "Endurance, RunB, ToughnessB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 12, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Plagued Steed", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "1", "Will": "1", "Race": "Plagued beast horse", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "?", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "docile", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +1", "Melee": "bite +5 (1d8+5 plus disease), 2 hooves +0 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Large"}
