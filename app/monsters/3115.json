The trapper attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals buffet damage each round the hold is maintained. Further, a grappled opponent must hold its breath or suffocate. Attacks that hit a smothering trapper deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Trappers are thought to be distant relatives of the lurker above (see that entry). Unlike their relatives, however, trappers mimic the floor of a building, dungeon, or other structure. By manipulating their body structure while covering the floor, trappers can form a box that resembles a small trunk or chest. This is usually enough to lure would-be-adventurers to their doom.</p><p>A trapper waits until its prey is almost centered on its body near the \"trunk\" or \"chest\" before it strikes. It then quickly folds and wraps its body around its unsuspecting prey attempting to smother and squeeze it until it is dead.</p><p>Credit The Trapper originally appeared in the <i>Strategic Review #5</i> (\u00a9 TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1975) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Undercommon (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d8+63)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 30, Dex 12, Con 19, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3115, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Skill Focus (Perception), Skill Focus (Stealth), Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+12 Stealth in areas of natural or worked stone", "AC": "19, touch 9, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Trapper", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +25, Knowledge (dungeoneering) +17, Knowledge (engineering) +14, Perception +23, Stealth +14 (+26 in areas of natural or worked stone), Survival +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +7, Will +10", "Melee": "buffet +17 (1d8+15)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
