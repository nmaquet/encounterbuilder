In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. <br> A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points. <br> A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round. </h5><h5><b>Slow (Su)</b> A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet in a burst centered on the golem and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to negate. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>A stone golem has a humanoid body made from stone, frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs. Its head is often carved to resemble a helmet or the head of some beast. While it may be sculpted to carry a stone shield or stone weapon such as a sword, these aesthetic choices do not affect its combat abilities.</p><p>Like most golems, a stone golem cannot speak and makes no sound other than the grinding of stone against stone when it moves. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds.</p><p><b>Construction</b><br> A stone golem's body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 3,000 pounds.
