They are highly aggressive and powerfully built carnivores that love the taste of human flesh and bones. Their appearance lends to the fa\u00e7ade of a sickly dog, which sometimes works to the retch hound's advantage when hunting its prey.</p><p>Retch hounds are often found in the service of powerful fighters and warriors, who use the dogs to guard prisoners, lead hunting expeditions, and perform other such services. A retch hound is only as loyal to its master as it has to be to insure its own survival. While the dog won't necessary seek escape at the earliest possible time, it often turns on its master at some point. Retch hounds raised in captivity are often more loyal to their masters than those captured in the wild. A typical retch hound stands 4 to 4 1/2 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 150 pounds.</p><p>Retch hounds hunt their prey in packs. Using an eerie howl, they seem to coordinate and communicate with one another during these hunts. A favored tactic of a retch hound pack is to encircle a foe and then hit it from all sides at once. Usually the largest hound in the pack is the leader.</p><p>When slain, a retch hound melts into a pile of stinking and bubbling slime.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (3-6)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 4", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2973, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Track", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +4 Survival when tracking by scent", "AC": "17, touch 12, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Retch Hound", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +12, Survival +6 (+10 scent tracking)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests and marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +5 (1d6+2 plus trip)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
