Creatures pinned underneath the blood are subject to drowning (see below). </h5><h5><b>Drench (Ex)</b> The weird's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can <i>dispel magic</i>al fire it touches as <i>dispel magic</i> cast by a sorcerer whose level equals the weird's HD total. </h5><h5><b>Drown (Ex)</b> If a blood weird grapples a foe, it can fully immerses its victim in its blood pool as a free action. A victim completely immersed must hold its breath or drown. See the \"Drowning\" section in the <i>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</i>. </h5><h5><b>Reform (Ex)</b> When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a blood weird collapses back into its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any damage taken from fire-based spells and effects. </h5><h5><b>Siphon (Su)</b> A blood weird that hits a foe siphons off a portion of its blood. This attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each time the blood weird hits. A creature struck can make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save to negate the ability damage that round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures without blood (GM's discretion) are immune to this effect. </h5><h5><b>Transparency (Ex)</b> A blood weird is effectively invisible in its pool until it attacks.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Sages are unsure as to the exact nature of the blood weird. Though classified as a weird, its plane of origin is unknown. Does there exist somewhere within the great configuration of inner and outer planes a plane composed entirely of blood? Some say yes. Others doubt it.</p><p>Whatever the truth, sage cannot argue the existence of the creature known as a blood weird.</p><p>Blood weirds are virtually unknown and so are rarely encountered outside their native plane. When summoned to the Material Plane, great care must be taken, for these creatures cannot exist without a large source of blood. Before summoning this creature, casters often fill a large basin or font with the blood of slain foes or captives.</p><p>Blood weirds wait patiently in their pool for potential prey. When a foe wanders close, the weird lashes out and intertwines itself around the opponent. On the next round, it attempts to fall back into its pool, bringing the grabbed opponent with it. Grabbed foes are either drowned or subjected to its siphoning attack.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Weirdling", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pack (2-4)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3423, "SubType": "(chaotic, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Improved Natural Attack (bite), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 12, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Blood Weird", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +16, Intimidate +16, Knowledge (planes) +14, Perception +18, Sense Motive +18, Stealth +12, Survival +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any liquid-based outer or inner plane", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "blood pool, reform", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +10, Will +8", "Melee": "bite +14 (2d6+6 plus siphon and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
