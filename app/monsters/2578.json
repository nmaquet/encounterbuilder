Its great tail appears as wisps of smoke or vapor and seems to trail off into nothingness.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Elemental Air Dragon</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 18</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>153,600</h5><h5>NE Huge outsider (air, elemental, extraplanar)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+8; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +29</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>32, touch 16, flat-footed 24 (+8 Dex, +16 natural, -2 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>252 (24d10+120)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+13, <b>Ref </b>+22, <b>Will </b>+16</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>air mastery; <b>DR </b>15/magic and silver; <b>Immune </b>elemental traits</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>20 ft., fly 120 ft.

This cyclone has the following effects: movement through the cyclone is one-quarter normal, ranged attacks suffer a -8 circumstance penalty in the area, and all nonmagical unprotected flames are automatically extinguished. Large or smaller creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 27 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round they remain in the area. Medium or smaller creatures in the area must succeed on a second Reflex save (same DC) or be knocked prone and back 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. Flying creatures are automatically grounded in this area. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The Plane of Air is home to many creatures. Yet none are as feared as the elemental air dragons. Their great form and majestic aura strike fear into the bravest of souls. Elemental air dragons are as evil as their brethren (the other elemental dragons) and take joy and pride in swooping over a settlement or village and destroying it with their great wing buffet. Watching the frightened creatures flee in terror provokes some sort of perverse excitement in these dragons. Luckily, elemental air dragons rarely enter the Material Plane. Elemental air dragons dislike cloud dragons and mist dragons and seek to slay them whenever they are encountered. The average air elemental dragon is 30 feet long.</p><p>Elemental air dragons attack by swooping on their prey, unleashing a blast of superheated air, and then flying away. An elemental air dragon rarely, if ever, touches the ground. It often employs its cyclone buffet to knock more powerful creatures prone, then swoops in to blast them with its breath weapon or rend them with its claws and bite.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "22", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(24d10+120)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 27, Con 21, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.
