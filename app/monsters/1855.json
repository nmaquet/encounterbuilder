In human form, the Cat Lord cannot use his natural weapons or his howl, pounce, spit, or rake special attacks but can wield weapons and wear armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Cat Lord retains his movement modes (and speeds) in human form. </h5><h5><b>Feline Passivism (Ex)</b> Felines (including dire versions) do not willingly attack the Cat Lord, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the Cat Lord attacks a feline, its protection against that creature ends. </h5><h5><b>Howl (Su)</b> When the Cat Lord howls, all creatures except felines within a 20-foot spread must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the Cat Lord's howl for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Immortality (Su)</b> The Cat Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Cat Lord's soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within 9 days, it inhabits another feline on the Material Plane and the Cat Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap his soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Cat Lord, it is thought that one must destroy every feline in existence (so his soul has no creature to inhabit). </h5><h5><b>Keen Senses (Ex)</b>: The Cat Lord sees five times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and normal light. </h5><h5><b>Spit (Ex)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds as a ranged attack, the Cat Lord can spit a line of caustic saliva at a single target to a range of 30 feet. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 24 Reflex save or be blinded. <i>Remove blindness</i> or <i>dispel magic</i> (vs. CL 19th) removes the blindness effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>There is only one. The Cat Lord is the Lord of All Felines. His natural form is that of a black panther with dark, ruby eyes. He can assume a human form, and in this form, he appears as a dark-skinned human with black hair, chiseled features, and ruby eyes. In human form, he stands 6 feet tall and he almost always dresses in black.</p><p>The Cat Lord spends his days roaming the Material Plane, Astral Plane, and Ethereal Plane.</p><p>In combat, the Cat Lord almost always assumes feline form (if he's not already in that form) and attacks with two claws and a bite. The Cat Lord often enters combat with both <i>haste</i> and <i>blur</i> in effect. If combat goes against him, he usually summons a group of felines to his aid or to cover his escape.</p><p>Credit The Cat Lord originally appeared in <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan, Druidic, Elven, Goblin, Gnome; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Cat Lord plus 3-6 lions or tigers, or 5-8 cheetahs)", "Ref": "20", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(19d10+95)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 25, Con 20, Int 19, Wis 17, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "spit +26 (blindness)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1855, "SubType": "(native, shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Acrobatic, Alertness, Athletic, Blind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claws)", "AlternateNameForm": "Panther Form", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "16", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics, +8 Stealth, +20 Acrobatics when jumping", "AC": "32, touch 20, flat-footed 25", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Cat Lord", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +38 (+50 when jumping), Climb +38, Escape Artist +26, Fly +9, Handle Animal +24, Heal +22, Knowledge (nature) +23, Perception +29, Sense Motive +29, Stealth +37, Survival +22, Swim +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "11", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forest", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "change shape (human and panther, polymorph)", "Saves": "Fort +16, Ref +20, Will +11", "Melee": "2 claws +27 (1d6+7 plus grab), bite +26 (1d8+7)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "60 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
