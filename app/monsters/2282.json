In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity damage <i>slow</i>s a brass man (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any <i>slow</i> effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the brass man to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.</h5><h5><b> Spit Molten Brass (Ex)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds (and no more than five times per day), a brass man can spit a stream of molten brass n a 30-foot line; damage 6d6 fire, Reflex half DC 15. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Brass men are humanoid-shaped constructs built by the powerful efreet of the City of Brass. They are created for the sole purpose of guarding some efreeti secret within the walls of the City. Some are created as battle allies and aid the efreet in battle against their enemies. They are rarely encountered elsewhere, though on occasion one is sent to the Material Plane by its efreet creator to retrieve an object or creature.</p><p>Brass men are very tough physical opponents and difficult to stop.</p><p>Typically a brass man begins combat by spitting molten brass on the closest opponent before moving into melee where it attacks with its huge greatsword or its powerful fists.<br><b>Construction</b><br> The construction of the brass men is a highly guarded secret among the efreet race. No one outside the City of Brass has ever discovered the proper method of constructing a brass man, and the efreet aren't telling.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Casey Christofferson.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or squad (2-4)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2282, "SubType": "(extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 9, flat-footed 23", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Brass Man", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "elemental plane of fire", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +3", "Melee": "2 slams +15 (2d8+6), or large greatsword +15/+10 (3d6+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
