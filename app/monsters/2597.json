The cone-shaped blast has a range of 60 ft and deals 12d6 points of damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Once a fire whale uses this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using its scalding blast again. After using this ability four times, the fire whale must submerge for at least two full rounds before it can use it again.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>All manner of fiery aquatic life swims the Sea of Fire, including the majestic fire whales. These 30-foot long mammals are relatively peaceful creatures, though if provoked they quickly become deadly adversaries.</p><p>Fire whales generally spend their time feeding on elemental invertebrates that move along the bottom of the Sea of Fire. When feeding, the fire whale dives to the bottom, flips on its side, and swims along, running its head through the fiery and oily sea floor scooping food into its mouth.</p><p>Fire whales generally take in enough food to sustain themselves for 4 months (during breeding season).</p><p>Late in the year (by Material Plane standards) fire whales gather for their mating ritual. During this time as many as 7 fire whales can be encountered together. Sages are unsure as to the purpose of the \"extra\" fire whales, but each spends its share rolling and milling with the others during this ritual. Gestation for fire whales is generally 11 months after which time the mother gives birth to 1d2 calves. While the calves are growing, both they and the mother spend most of their time in the shallower ends of the Sea of Fire. After nearly 7 months, they migrate to deeper waters and most calves swim away and become independent.</p><p>Young reach maturity around 6 years of age.</p><p>Fire whales are hunted by various races for their meat, blubber, and oil.</p><p>Of the races that hunt them the most are the salamanders, volcano giants (see their entry in this book), and the efreet of the City of Brass.</p><p>Fire whales are generally peaceful creatures and rarely attack unless threatened. If forced into combat, a fire whale attacks with its bite and tail slap. Surface creatures that threaten a fire whale are subjected to its scalding blast attack.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pod (4-9)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+72)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 35, Dex 13, Con 23, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2597, "SubType": "(extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Diehard, Endurance, Improved Bull Rush, Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "19, touch 9, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Fire Whale", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +14, Swim +29", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Sea of Fire (Elemental Plane of Fire or Plane of Molten Skies)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "hold breath", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +9, Will +7", "Melee": "bite +22 (3d6+12), tail slap +19 (1d6+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "Swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
