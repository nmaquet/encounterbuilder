An arach cannot multispell spells higher than 5th-level. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Arach Venom: Bite-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 17; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 4 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Str; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>. An arach can also coat a single weapon it wields with this poison as a move action. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Spider Passivism (Ex)</b> No spiders, monstrous spiders, phase spiders, temporal crawlers, sand stalkers, arachnid werecreatures (such as werespiders) or other spider-like creatures with an Intelligence of 8 or less willingly attack an arach. They can be forced to do so through magical means however. If the arach or one of its allies attacks the creature first, this passivism is negated for that creature for 24 hours.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Arachs are a strange union of sentient arachnids and humanoids. With the exception of their heads, they are completely hairless, and their skin ranges from glossy brown to grey and pitch black with white plates on the males and red plates on the females. Many believe they were once worshippers of the spider god who long ago were granted this horrid transformation.</p><p>Arachs live in small colonies (called nests among their own kind) in caves and caverns deep underground. They generally shun other subterranean races preferring to keep company with their own kind. Occasionally an arach nest makes an alliance with a band of driders though such a union is usually short-lived (the races get along, but don't particularly like each other for unknown reasons). A nest is led by the most powerful spellcaster among the members, usually a sorcerer or wizard of at least 7th level.</p><p>Arach nests include an equal number of male and female members.</p><p>Both forage and hunt for the nest, and in times of battle, both fight to defend the lair. During mating season, females are less active as they await the birth of their young. Young are always born live and a typical female spawns 1d4 young at one time. Young arachs reach maturity after 6 years.</p><p>An arach stands about 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.</p><p>Arach spellcasters open with a whirlwind of blows from their swordwielding arms. Arach fighters either opt for multiple blows from their short swords, or wield two large weapons or pole arms with no penalty for off handed attacks due to their use of three arms to balance and attack.</p><p>An arach spellbinder opens combat with a <i>lightning bolt</i> or <i>touch of idiocy</i> (if an opponent is within range). It follows this with a <i>magic missile</i> assault and then continues the battle mixing sword attacks and spell attacks.</p><p>All arachs summon spiders in the first round of combat if possible to absorb larger numbers of enemies or quickly overwhelm smaller numbers of foes.</p><p><br></br><b>Arach Characters</b><br></br> Arachs have racial Hit Dice and can have class levels.
