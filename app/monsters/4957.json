As brutal as their lesser cousins, they are also highly intelligent, possessing the knowledge of ancient runes with which they may tap into great magical powers. The jotun lineage is said to go back to that of the elder gods, with some jotun females having been the mothers of demigods still worshipped by various races to this day. Jotuns are held as nobility amongst normal frost giant tribes, who obey them as the true children of the frost giant god. Jotuns love games of chance, puzzles and conundrums. The sometimes offer prisoners such a game to win their freedom; of course, the jotun frequently cheat at these games, taking perverse pleasure in doing so. Unlike normal frost giants, Jotuns have a taste for finery, not usually found amongst their lesser cousins. They prefer masterwork and magical gear as well as finely tailored furs to the sloppy filth of normal frost giants. Truly ancient jotuns rival titans in size and the power of their illusions. A jotun's skin is white as snow and their eyes glitter like blue diamonds. Their hair color ranges from red, yellow, blue-grey and even white. Females of the species are quite beautiful and have been known to seduce human men to their death with their feminine wiles. Jotun females are frequently sorcerers. Adult males stand 15-17 feet tall and weigh between 2,800 and 3,200 lbs. Females are only slightly smaller averaging 14-16 feet in height. Jotuns' have a potential lifespan of over 1,000 years and continue to grow in size and magical prowess throughout the span of their lives. It is not uncommon for a jotun to have a few levels of sorcerer, wizard (Illusionist) or cleric as well as their natural powers and abilities. A jotun prefers to conceal itself with powerful illusions and take its enemies by surprise, attacking one opponent at a time until all are subdued or slain. When ganged up on by greater numbers of smaller foes it overruns them, stomping its opponents into the snow, slaughtering them before they have a chance to rise. When threatened with death, a jotun may attempt to flee or barter for its life.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "Solitary, gang (2-4), band (2-4 plus 2-8 frost giants plus 1 wizard or cleric of 3rd-5th level), hunting/raiding party (3-6 plus 3-9 frost giants plus 1 cleric or wizard of 4th-8th level plus 2-4 winter wolves and 2-3 ogres), or tribe (10-20 plus 15-30 frost giants plus 35% noncombatants plus 1 wizard, cleric, or sorcerer of 6th or 10th level plus 12-30 winter wolves, 12-22 ogres, and 1-2 young white dragons)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d8+80)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 31, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rock +11 (1d8+15)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4957, "SubType": "(cold, giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Critical Focus, Great Cleave, Improved Overrun, Improved Sunder, Martial Weapon Proficiency (greataxe), Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+6 Stealth in snow", "AC": "23, touch 9, flat-footed 23", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Jotun", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +22, Craft (any) +11, Diplomacy +9, Intimidate +14, Knowledge (any) +10, Knowledge (local) +8, Perception +15, Stealth +6 (+12 in snow)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +5, Will +7", "Melee": "mwk greataxe +22/+17/+12 (3d6+15) or 2 slams +21 (1d6+10)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
