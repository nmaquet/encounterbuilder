Most narwhals prefer colder waters and as such will be more commonly encountered in arctic environments. These creatures do not like warm waters and are never encountered in such places. Mistakenly, many who encounter a narwhal believe it to have a horn growing from its head. Closer inspection reveals this to be false however. The horn is actually a single tooth that grows straight from the creature's mouth and can reach lengths of 10 feet or more. Narwhals use this horn to defend themselves and their young. Narwhals spend the majority of their time swimming through the oceans feasting upon smaller sea life and plants (including coral, one of their favorite meals). A typical narwhal school consists of 2-6 adults and twice as many (noncombatant) young. Young narwhals lack the horn that adults have (though by age 2 it has grown in). Narwhals typically average 10 to 12 feet in length, though they can grow to a length of 15 feet. A typical narwhal weighs up to 1-1/2 tons. Narwhals understand Celestial and Common but cannot speak. Narwhals are generally non-aggressive creatures only entering battle when threatened, when their pod is threatened, or when it sees a good-aligned creature in trouble. Upon entering battle, a narwhal uses its horn to spear and impale its enemies. When <i>aid</i>ing good-aligned creatures (or facing evil-aligned creatures on its own), a narwhal uses its <i>bless</i> and <i>magic circle</i> spell-like abilities to <i>aid</i> itself and its allies.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Common (can't speak any)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pod (3-6 plus 6-12 noncombatant young)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+15)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5016, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Swim-By Attack, Weapon Focus (gore)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Narwhal", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +12, Swim +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold and temperate oceans", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "ghost form, hold breath", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +6, Will +3", "Melee": "gore +10 (2d6+5) or slam +9 (1d8+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 50 ft.", "Alignment": "NG", "Size": "Large"}
