This deals 2d6+12 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent must make a successful DC 24 Fortitude save or be stunned for one round. A cave giant can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Oversized Weapon Use (Ex)</b> A cave giant wields a Gargantuan greatclub without penalty.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Dumber, stronger cousins of hill giants, cave giants live in small communal bands of no more than twelve individuals, with a single male leader that is usually stronger and certainly meaner than all others. They often take up residence in large hill or mountain caves, foraging for food such as mountain goats, bears, and wayward explorers. Extremely primitive and simple-minded, cave giants have no real concept of fire or creature comforts, so they eat their food raw.</p><p>Cave giants are not rock-throwers like many of their brethren, but they are quite skilled at combat with their huge greatclubs. They take great glee in pounding humans into paste, and then eating the paste.</p><p><br></br><b>Cave Giant Characters</b><br> <br><b>+16 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +12 Constitution, -6 Intelligence.</b> Cave giants are dumb, indestructible brutes of primitive intelligence and reasoning and make excellent barbarians.<br><b>Huge</b>: Cave giants are Huge and take a -2 penalty to AC, -2 penalty to attack rolls, +2 bonus to Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense, and a -8 penalty to Stealth checks.
