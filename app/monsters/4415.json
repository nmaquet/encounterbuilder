The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or lose any ability it had to reproduce or bear children. This effect can only be removed by a <i>heal</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell. Creatures that magically reproduce are not affected by this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Rebirth (Su)</b> Once per day, a veranallia can <i>reincarnate</i> a creature she deems worthy of the honor. The creature's original body decays and sinks into the ground, affecting the surrounding area in a 1/2-mile radius as though with <i>plant growth</i> (enrichment). Over the course of 1d4 days, a white, flowery cocoon emerges from the affected ground and splits open, revealing the newly <i>reincarnate</i>d creature inside. Creatures <i>reincarnate</i>d by a veranallia always return to life as aasimars. This ability otherwise functions as the <i>reincarnate</i> spell. </h5><h5><b>Spells</b> Veranallias cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics and have access to some druid spells. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities. </h5><h5><b>Winter Sickle (Ex)</b> At will as a free action, a veranallia can create a jagged blade from her hoarfrost-covered vines that acts as a <i>+3 icy burst sickle</i>. One round after it leaves the veranallia's grasp, the weapon melts into a small puddle of water.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Veranallias are among the most powerful azatas known and embody the changing of the seasons, from blossoming spring to dormant winter. They command the growth and decay of plants, control various aspects of the weather, and enrich soil with the remains of fallen foes. A veranallia stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds. Beautiful and majestic, the queenly veranallia possesses a form that combines aspects of a feylike woman and the subtle power of nature. A veranallia appears humanoid from the waist up, but where her thighs and legs should be, sprout countless vines, leaves, and various kinds of plant matter instead. These flora represent the life of plants throughout all stages of the year, continually shifting from blooming, verdant colors and textures to crisp, withered specimens and back in a matter of seconds. Veranallias hail from the wildest regions of Elysium, primeval realms where few but the mightiest azatas dare tread. They are creatures of transition, preferring the unpredictable maelstroms of weather at Elysium's edges to the more temperate or consistent regions of that plane. They also have a particular appreciation for areas where one element transitions into another, such as coastlines, geysers, hot springs, and underground lakes. Many among their kind can be found in the lush Field of Broken Tyrants or various heavily wooded forests throughout Elysium; as many as a dozen veranallias are reputed to dwell among the ever-changing trees and plants of the Painted Forest, and it is thought their annual tribunals are actually the source of the eldritch woodland's transformative climate and continually shifting composition. At first glance, a veranallia's lower body may appear to be made of living plants that wrap themselves around her, but these vines are in fact a part of the azata's strange physiology. Despite this, she is not subject to <i>b<i>light</i></i> or similar plant-affecting magic, and attempts to use such abilities to hinder her inspire a veranallia's ire like little else. A veranallia's vines are incredibly strong and can entwine and crush an enemy as easily as a python would crush a field mouse. These vines often change appearance based on the veranallia's environment, but not always in any predictable or sensible manner. Veranallias prefer the company of other azatas, and may have any number of faithful bralani or ghaele followers. Their fickle natures make it difficult for most other creatures, even other azatas, to interact with them. Lillends are not inspired by the dangerous power of veranallias, and brijidines' belief in the cleansing power of fire does not make friendship with the verdant veranallias easy. While most other celestials concede that veranallias have only the best intentions, most would still rather deal with more predictable members of the celestial planes. Archons in particular find it almost impossible to speak to veranallias, and the noble angels and agathions have trouble following a veranallia's leaps in logic and rapidly shifting moods. Due to their power and inf luence, it takes a force of great evil to slay veranallias. When a veranallia does die, however, her body explodes into a fine glittering dust that covers a radius of up to a mile. This area becomes exceedingly fertile and subject to indeterminate weather. Storms, snowfalls, heat waves, and gentle showers come by turns regardless of the region's usual climate. Veranallias who have died on the evil Outer Planes have left such fertile areas behind, but the soil inevitably becomes corrupted again, giving rise to vile creatures such as sards and spawning vicious weather patterns. Hardy plane-traveling adventurers speak of ancient veranallias living in the remotest corners of Elysium, and claim that these unique azatas possess even greater mastery over the elements than their more commonly encountered kin. Veranallias with the ability to shower entire mountains with lightning or cause heat waves so intense that they turn lakes to sand are spoken of in arcane texts in the Great Library of Harmonious Scripture of Heaven.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Draconic, Infernal; speak with plants; truespeech", "Source": "Chronicle Of The Righteous", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or grove (3-6)", "Ref": "16", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(24d10+192)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 26, Con 25, Int 18, Wis 27, Cha 29", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.
