Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or be blinded for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures to whom sunlight is harmful or unnatural take 2d6 points of damage from the light. Undead creatures caught within the area take 3d6 points of damage, and undead particularly vulnerable to sunlight, such as vampires, take 3d8 points of damage. Creatures that cannot see or perceive objects through the use of vision are unaffected by the blindness, but still suffer damage if they are vulnerable to sunlight. </h5><h5><b>Constitution Damage (Ex)</b> A crystalline horror that confirms a critical hit with a claw attack deals 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss when it hits a creature. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by a crystalline horror's claws. </h5><h5><b>Crystal Claws (Ex)</b> A crystalline horror's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </h5><h5><b>Shard Spray (Ex)</b> A crystalline horror can loose a spray of razor-sharp shards of glass from its body in a 40-foot cone. A creature in the area takes 4d6 points of damage or half that amount if it succeeds on a DC 18 Reflex save. The crystalline horror can launch only five such sprays in a given day. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>A crystalline horror is a weird, unnatural humanoid composed of crystal and glass. Sages believe it to be from one of the elemental planes, but in fact, the crystalline horror is a creature whose origins lie on the Material Plane. How it came to be remains speculation among many sages and scholars, though all agree it is in fact a living creature and not an automaton.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "Solitary", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+7 plus 7)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2408, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (shard spray), Dodge, Improved Initiative, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 13, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Crystalline Horror", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +14, Perception +11, Stealth +12, Swim +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +6", "Melee": "2 claws +9 (1d6+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
