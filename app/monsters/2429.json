A tarry demodand has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks due to its tarry secretions in addition to that provided by its grab ability. A weapon that strikes a tarry demodand is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. A successful DC 19 Strength check is needed to pry it off. The save DC and check DC are Constitution-based. Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive. A pint of wine or a similar liquid weakens it, but the tarry demodand can still grapple normally. A tarry demodand can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 1 minute after the creature dies. </h5><h5><b>Rage (Ex)</b> A tarry demodand that takes damage in combat has a 50% chance of flying into a berserk rage the following round, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 Strength and -4 AC. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily. While raging, make the following adjustments to the tarry demodand's statistics: <b>AC</b> 23, touch 11, flat-footed 18; <b>CMB</b> +20 (+28 grapple); <b>CMD</b> 35; <b>Melee</b> 2 claws +21 melee (1d6+9), bite +20 melee (1d8+9); <b>Str</b> 28</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The cruel and malevolent tarry demodands wander the planes of Tarterus as soldiers and warriors in the mighty demodand armies. They are often employed by the shaggy demodands to battle daemons, demons, and devils. Tarry demodands care little for anything and attack just about anything weaker than them.</p><p>A typical tarry demodand stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 420 pounds.</p><p>The tarry demodand attacks with its claws and bite, though it usually opens combat using its spell-like abilities. Should it fly into a rage, it attacks relentlessly until its opponent is slain. Any creature that becomes stuck to the tarry demodand is shredded by its wicked claws.</p><p>Credit The Tarry Demodand originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (2-5)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d10+44)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 20, Con 19, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "Outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2429, "SubType": "(chaotic, demodand, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Great Cleave, Iron Will, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claws)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "27, touch 15, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Terry Demodand", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +17, Fly +13, Knowledge (arcana) +15, Knowledge (planes) +15, Perception +19, Sense Motive +12, Stealth +19, Survival +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Tarterus)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +8, Will +10", "Melee": "2 claws +19 (1d6+7 plus grab), bite +18 (1d8+7)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
