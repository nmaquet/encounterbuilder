The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Spawn of Jubilex were once human creatures corrupted by foul and dark rituals at the hands of Jubilex the Faceless Lord. The first known sighting of these creatures was in the Citadel (see <i>G5 Chaos Rising</i>, by Necromancer Games) when Jubilex used his power to corrupt a group of dwarves (known now as The Corrupted). Using his dark magic, Jubilex slayed the dwarves, liquefied their remains, and reanimated them as his spawn. Spawn are not mindless, but do not retain much of their former lives. Fleeting memories perhaps, but nothing else seems to remain. These creatures are hateful and attack anything they encounter. Spawn look as they did in their former lives, save they are covered in a thick, black slime that constantly weeps from their bodies. Spawn attack with weapons, favoring weapons they used in their former life. These creatures rarely retreat from battle, their ever-consuming hatred driving them to their own destruction.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or warband (2-7)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+49)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 8, Con 24, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5024, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Blind-Fight, Improved Initiative, Iron Will", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 9, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Spawn Of Juiblex", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +9, Sense Motive +2, Stealth +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +1, Will +4", "Melee": "mwk greataxe +10 (1d12+6 plus 1d6 acid) or 2 slams +9 (1d6+4 plus 1d6 acid)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.
