Once activated, a sepulchral guardian performs its task until it is destroyed. Even the death of its creator does not disrupt a sepulchral guardian as many are created to guard the final resting place of the one that created them.</p><p>A sepulchral guardian appears as a humanoid standing just over 6 feet tall. Its entire body, save its face is encased in a suit of iron. Its face, while humanoid, shows no signs of life, and its eyes are filled with the emptiness of an automaton. Most sepulchral guardians wield longswords, battleaxes, or other such weapons. A sepulchral guardian weighs about 900 pounds.</p><p>Sepulchral guardians cannot speak and do not utter any sound.</p><p>Sepulchral guardians attack with deadly accuracy, relying on either a longsword or their powerful fists in battle. They are relentless combatants and attack until destroyed or until their foes are slain or driven from the area they are protecting. A sepulchral guardian never gives pursuit, refusing to leave its assigned area.</p><p><br><b>Construction</b><br> A sepulchral guardian' body is constructed from 500 pounds of iron mixed with rare chemicals totaling 1,000 gp and the preserved corpse of a single humanoid (which is encased in the iron).</p><p>SEPULCHRAL GUARDIAN <br><b>CL</b> 11th; <b>Price</b> 41,000 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>contagion</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, creator must be caster level 11th; <b>Skill</b> Craft (armor or weapons) DC 15; <b>Cost</b> 21,000 gp Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 12", "Gear": "+1 longsword", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3004, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 10, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sepulchral Guardian", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +3", "Melee": "+1 longsword +18/+13 (1d8+8), 2 slams +17 (2d6+7 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
