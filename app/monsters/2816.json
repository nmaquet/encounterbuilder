Creatures in the area that are not immune or resistant to cold may take damage as detailed in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Corebook</i> (see Cold Hazards).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Mimis are 1-foot tall mischievous creatures that inhabit cold forests and fields and derive pleasure from playing tricks on creatures that wander into their icy realm. Mimi tricks are always harmless and include such things as throwing snowballs at a creature, creating a patch of ice on the ground and watching a creature slip and fall, or turning invisible and sneaking into a sleeping creature's camp wherein they put snow or ice in the creature's boots, clothes, or backpack.</p><p>While frolicsome, mimis are generally good-natured and friendly towards those they encounter. They often lend aid to creatures in need, especially those that have helped a mimi in the past. Mimis will not lend aid or assistance to creatures of a malign nature and tend to avoid such creatures if possible. They are on good terms with most other fey creatures, though they find brownies to be a little too \"stiff\" for their liking and buckawns to be a bit too gruff.</p><p>Druids and rangers can detect the presence of a mimi or group of mimis with a successful DC Survival check.</p><p>Mimis are non-aggressive creatures and rarely attack, unless potential adversaries are inherently evil. They prefer to avoid combat if at all possible but if drawn in, they open using their <i>frost fingers</i>. Against more powerful opponents, mimis begin combat by blasting their foes with a <i>cone of cold</i>.</p><p>A persistent foe that wishes to continue the battle against a mimi (after being hit with its <i>frost fingers</i> or <i>cone of cold</i>) is subjected to a rapid decrease in the surrounding temperature. A mimi lowers the temperature just enough to possibly damage an adversary (see cold dangers in the <i>Pathfinder Core</i> Rulebook) and maybe force it away; its goal is not to kill it.</p><p>Mimis usually turn invisible and flee if they cannot drive their opponents away.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Elven, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-4), band (6-11), or tribe (20-80)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d6+1)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 4, Dex 19, Con 14, Int 15, Wis 13, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2816, "SubType": "(cold)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "DodgeB, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "19, touch 17, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mimi", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +6, Craft (any one) +6, Escape Artist +8, Perception +5, Perform (limericks) +6, Perform (sing) +6, Sense Motive +5, Stealth +16, Survival +2,", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold forest and plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +6, Will +3", "Melee": "short sword +6 (1d3-3),", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., fly 50 ft.
