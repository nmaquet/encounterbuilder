Without such a coating, they lose their regeneration ability and eventually suffocate. They can survive away from their murky home for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, see the suffocation rules in Chapter 13 of the <i>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</i>. They cannot regenerate while subject to suffocation from being away from their swamp for too long.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Swamp trolls are large, stocky, dark gray or brown hunched humanoids.</p><p>Their flesh is slick and slimy like moss. Swamp trolls make their lairs deep in swampland and marshes away from more settled areas, but not far enough away where they cannot hunt humans if game and other food runs scarce in the swamps.</p><p>Swamp trolls are 7-foot tall hunched humanoids and weigh about 400 pounds.</p><p>Swamp trolls are aggressive predators that attack living creatures on sight (especially when a swamp troll is hungry). When hunting a swamp troll moves quietly along, easing closer to its prey and then finally striking with its claws and bite when within range. Swamp trolls rarely fight to the death unless threatened or hungry.<br><b>Swamp Troll Characters</b><br> Swamp troll characters possess the following racial traits.<br><b>+8 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +10 Constitution, -4 Intelligence (minimum 3), -2 Wisdom, -6 Charisma.</b><br><b>Large size:</b> -1 penalty to Armor Class, -1 penalty on attack rolls, -4 penalty on Stealth checks, +1 bonus on CMB and CMD checks, lifting and carrying limits double those of Medium characters.<br><b>Space/Reach:</b> 10 feet/10 feet.<br><b>Darkvision:</b> Swamp trolls can see in the dark out to 60 feet.<br><b>Low-light vision:</b> Swamp trolls can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.<br><b>Scent:</b> Swamp trolls can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell.<br><b>Racial Hit Dice:</b> A swamp troll begins with four levels of humanoid, which provide 4d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +3, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +4, Ref +1, and Will +1.<br><b>Racial Skills:</b> A swamp troll's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 4 x (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1).
