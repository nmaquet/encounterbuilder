After using its gaze attack in this manner, the slorath cannot use its paralyzing gaze for 1d4 rounds and it is disoriented during this time (-2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks). The save is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The great sloraths are found only in the coldest and most desolate regions, though close enough to civilization to hunt and stage raids against humanoid settlements when the slorath goes hunting. Highly intelligent and aware, the slorath is a fierce predator that defends its hunting ground with precision tactics and power. Small villages within a slorath's territory sometimes strike deals with these creatures; offering sacrifices in return for the protection the slorath can offer.</p><p>Slorath are generally nocturnal carnivores. They exist on a diet of white dragons, polar bears, frost men (see entry in this book), and barbegazi (see entry in this book). They are particularly fond of white dragon meat and often go out of their way to hunt for such creatures. Frost giants often strike deals with frost giants so it is not uncommon for the two to be encountered together working toward a common goal.</p><p>Slorath lairs are either enormous tunnels deep under the ice and snow or abandoned white dragon lairs. Encounters are almost always with a solitary creature. In rare instances young sloraths or eggs might be found in a lair. Young slorath resemble their parent in all respects. Slorath eggs are stark white in color.</p><p>A slorath usually begins an encounter by hiding under the snow waiting for prey to wander by, or by lying unmoving on the snow itself where its coloration offers it camouflage against the white background. When prey comes within range, the slorath assaults it with its paralyzing gaze.</p><p>Helpless creatures are then attacked with its powerful bite. Those that attempt to avoid its gaze witness the slorath project its gaze as a ray of blue energy (using the Gaze to Ray feat).</p><p>Continued aggression against a slorath results in it unleashing a <i>cone of cold</i> or <i>ice storm</i> on its foes. If faced with particularly powerful foes, it uses its <i>ice storm</i> and <i>glacial storm</i> special abilities. A slorath does not fight to the death and flees if combat goes against it. Note however, if young slorath are present and they are threatened, a slorath fights to the death.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic, Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "17", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(20d10+140)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 31, Dex 17, Con 24, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "paralysis ray +20 (paralysis)", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3024, "SubType": "(cold)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Gaze to Ray, Improved Initiative, Improved Bullrush, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Quicken Spell-Like Ability, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (ray)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "19", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+10 Stealth in arctic environments", "AC": "25, touch 9, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Slorath", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +14, Climb +20, Perception +26, Spellcraft +22, Stealth +14 (+24 in arctic environments), Swim +20", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "18", "XP": 153600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold hills and mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +19, Ref +17, Will +10", "Melee": "bite +26 (2d8+15)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., burrow 10 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Gargantuan"}
