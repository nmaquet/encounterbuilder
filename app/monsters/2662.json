A gorilla bear's fur is always dark and ranges in color from jet black to brownish-black. Its paws and feet end in elongated nails, brown in color. A typical gorilla bear stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 1,700 pounds. Its eyes are always one of two colors crimson or emerald green. No other eye color has ever been seen on a gorilla bear (though legends speak of an immensely powerful white-Furred gorilla bear with eyes the color of amethysts).</p><p>Gorilla bears make their lairs in caves or caverns, often hidden among the twisted tangle of trees and shrubs of jungles. They are diurnal (daylight) hunters and feast on a diet of meat, savoring the taste of goblins and elves. A typical lair contains a mated pair and 1d4 young.</p><p>Gorilla bears are highly aggressive and attack their prey relentlessly.</p><p>Gorilla bears never retreat and always fight until either they are all dead or their opponents are all dead. Opponents that attempt to flee are usually run down. Gorilla bears attack with their claws, cutting huge chunks of flesh from a foe when a claw attack hits. When presented with the opportunity, gorilla bears grab their opponent and squeeze them until dead, gnashing and biting at a grappled foe with their pointed teeth. Slain prey is dragged back to the lair and divided among the young and adults.</p><p>Credit The Gorilla Bear originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Cricky Hitchcock.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (3-6)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+16 plus 4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 15, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2662, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Climb, +2 Swim", "AC": "16, touch 11, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gorilla Bear", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +11, Perception +9, Swim +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "2 claws +8 (1d8+5 plus grab), bite +8 (1d8+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
