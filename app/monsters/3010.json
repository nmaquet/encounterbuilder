This is a negative energy effect. This is a function of the black skeleton itself, not its weapons. </h5><h5><b>Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex)</b> A black skeleton usually fights with a short sword in each hand. Because of its magical nature, its Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with both weapons at no penalty.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Black skeletons were first encountered in Rappan Athuk (see the adventure, Rappan Athuk Reloaded from Necromancer Games).</p><p>Much more powerful than standard skeletons, these minions of evil are often employed as guardians or protectors to keep sealed some ancient knowledge best left undiscovered. They are intelligent monsters and are not subject to the mindless commands that can be given to such undead as skeletons or zombies. They have a clear mind, and sometimes go against the commands and wishes of those they serve, if it benefits the black skeleton in question.</p><p>Black skeletons are the remnants of living creatures slain in an area where the ground is soaked through with evil. The bodies of fallen heroes are contaminated and polluted by such evil and within days after their death, the slain creatures rise as black skeletons, leaving their former lives and bodies behind. Black skeletons are intelligent and do maintain some memories of their former lives.</p><p>Black skeletons wear any clothes or armor they had in life, and some still carry their gear or weapons (most discard their weapons in favor of two short swords as soon as they can).</p><p>Black skeletons attack with two short swords in battle with little more than the intention of cutting their foes to pieces. They are intelligent opponents and will use tactics during battle, often sending several of their number against a foe's front, while the others move into position to flank their adversaries. Black skeletons are smart enough to know when the battle is lost and withdraw from combat, though rarely. Most simply fight to the death, driven by some unseen hatred for the living.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Bill Webb.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "any", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+14)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 11, Dex 19, Con -, Int 13, Wis 10, Cha 14", "Gear": "2 short swords", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3010, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (short sword)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 14, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Black Skeleton", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +11, Climb +10, Escape Artist +11, Perception +10, Stealth +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +6, Will +5", "Melee": "2 short swords +10 (1d6/19-20 plus 1d3 Strength damage) or 2 claws +9 (1d4 plus 1d3 Strength damage)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
