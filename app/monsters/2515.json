He may use one each round as a standard action. Each gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet and has a save DC of 47 (CL 39th). The save DC is Charisma-based. <i>Descent into Evil</i>: Any creature meeting Lucifer's gaze must make a successful Will save or have his alignment shift one step toward lawful evil on the law-chaos axis or the good- evil axis. A lawful evil creature is unaffected by this gaze attack. A successful save renders a creature immune to this gaze weapon for one day. <i>Curse</i>: Any creature meeting Lucifer's gaze must succeed at a Will save or be affected as if by a double-strength <i>bestow curse</i> spell (-12 to one ability score or -6 to two ability scores; or -8 enhancement penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks; or each turn the target has a 25% chance to act normally, otherwise he takes no action; Lucifer chooses the curse when he uses this special attack). A successful save renders a creature immune to this gaze weapon for one day. This curse can be dispelled by making a caster level check against DC 50. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Sting-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 48; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 10 rounds; <i>effect</i> 2d6 Con damage; <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive <i>save</i>s.. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b><i><i>Rod</i> of Infernus</i></b> Lucifer's black iron rod functions as a Huge <i>+6 trident</i> that he can wield without penalty. It has the following abilities: <i>Annihilation Ray</i>: Once per round, and no more than five times per day, the rod can fire a ray to a range of 60 feet. A creature struck by this ray must succeed on a DC 40 Fortitude save or be annihilated instantly-not even a trace of dust is left behind. No form of mortal magic can restore life to a creature annihilated by this ray. Lucifer or a deity can restore the annihilated creature to life using magic. <i><i>Rod</i> of Rulership</i>: The rod has all of the abilities and powers of a <i>rod of rulership</i>. <i>Trap the Soul</i>: Once per round, and no more than three times per day, the rod can fire a ray of hellish-red energy to a range of 60 feet that functions as a <i>trap the soul</i> spell (CL 20th). A target can make a DC 40 Will save to resist the effects. If failed, the victim's soul vanishes into Lucifer's rod. Up to 10 such souls can be held in the rod at one time. A trapped soul may be freed by grasping the rod and speaking a command word. Any non-devil that touches the rod takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches the rod. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 40 and can result in actual level loss on a failed save. The negative levels cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells) while the rod is wielded. Any goodaligned creature that touches the rod takes 3d6 points of Constitution drain each round it touches the rod (DC 40 Fortitude save for half). </h5><h5><b><i>Hell's Redoubt</i></b>: Hell's Redoubt is Lucifer's Large suit of <i>+5 heavy fortification banded mail</i> that has no armor check penalty, speed penalty, and no chance for arcane spell failure. It was personally crafted for him the hands of Cheshimiboth, Armorer of the Nine Hells, just prior to the Great Uprising. To reward this unique devil's genius for crafting, Lucifer had him murdered in the first moments of the Uprising to prevent him from ever revealing any vulnerability in the armor he fashioned or ever again crafting its equal. In addition to its fortification qualities, three times per day, Lucifer can cause the fires of Hell to spring forth <i>stationary once called forth)</i>. <i>These fires last for 3 rounds</i> and deal 10d6 points of fire damage per round (DC 40 Reflex save for half) and ignore all fire <i>resistance</i> and fire immunity. Only the wearer of the armor is immune to their effects. Those slain by these fires are completely destroyed (including their equipment) and cannot be returned to life through anything short of divine intervention. Hell's Redoubt functions as <i>+1 banded mail</i> and bestows five negative levels for as long as it is worn if worn by anyone other than Lucifer unless the wearer defeats Asmodeus and gains the Throne of Hell. At that point it resumes its ordinary function. Anyone wearing the armor is filled with the overwhelming urge to attempt to do that very thing no matter the cost. The negative levels disappear if the armor is removed.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Lucifer has many names: The Prince of Lies, The Prince of Darkness, The Adversary, The Prince of Light, and Satan. It is believed that Lucifer was the first devil in existence, having been cast down from the heavens when he challenged the rulings of the gods of law and good. After being cast down, Lucifer constructed a plane he called Hell. There he built his palace of iron and basalt on the lowest and darkest region of Hell. He divided this realm into nine distinct regions and appointed his closest allies to rule. Each lord was allowed to mold and shape his domain as he <i>saw fit</i>, <i>but all paid homage to Lucifer</i>.</p><p>A millennia passed and Lucifer reigned supreme in Hell. During this time, one of the lieutenants (each of which had now become known as arch-devils or rulers) decided he could do a much better job of running Hell than Lucifer could. Asmodeus coveted the Throne of Hell and wanted it for himself. Using his powers of persuasion, he promised each and every other arch-devil that stood with him and challenged Lucifer a larger role in the \"new\" Hells. Those that stood against him, he said, would be destroyed or cast out of Hell along with Lucifer when the end came. This time in Hell's history became known as the Great Uprising.</p><p>Asmodeus managed to sway every single arch-devil, save one. Belial refused to stand with Asmodeus and barely escaped capture at the hands of the other arch-devils. When the battle for Hell's Throne commenced, Belial, Lucifer, and their allies stood fast against the mighty armies of the other arch-devils. In the end however, the sheer numbers of devils that fought against Lucifer overwhelmed his armies and those that stood with him. Lucifer and his allies were forced to flee Hell or face <i>destruction</i>.</p><p>The sole exception was Belial. Near the end of the war when he saw that Lucifer would likely lose the Throne, Belial turned and joined Asmodeus' ranks and helped oust Lucifer from Hell.</p><p>Cast out, Lucifer wanted vengeance. But vengeance required power, and he was tired, injured, and weakened from the time spent battling in Hell. He needed a place to rest, a place to grow in power, and a place to plan. Thus he created Infernus, a plane of eternal and everlasting fire and suffering: one plane, one ruler; created by his own hands, his own blood, and a portion of his very essence. From his great keep, <i>Malefacta</i>, Lucifer waits for the day he can challenge for the Throne of Hell again.</p><p>Lucifer is said to be one with the plane. As the gods of law are to the planes of good, so is Lucifer to Infernus. Nothing goes unnoticed by him on Infernus. All movements are seen, all whispers are heard. A plan is not <i>hatched or contrived without Lucifer's knowledge</i>. <i>When people speak of</i> Infernus, they speak of Lucifer and vice versa. No creature, it is thought, stands a chance against Lucifer on Infernus, not even the arch-devils that stood against him during the Great Uprising. But Lucifer knows that when the battle comes, he will have to fight the arch-devils on their own planes, not on Infernus, and he is preparing for just that. By sending his agents to the Material Plane to corrupt good-aligned beings and convert those currently paying homage to Hell's rulers, Lucifer grows in strength. And this strength gives him power, power that surpasses any he ever had- including his near deific powers he possessed in the planes of good. And when his power finally reaches its pinnacle, he will travel to Hell and destroy it and every single inhabitant.</p><p>Lucifer stands 10 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.</p><p>Lucifer rarely engages in combat (and even less rarely does he engage in melee combat), preferring to summon pit fiends to fight his would-be challengers. If he does enter combat, he fights with his <i>Rod</i>, spells, spell-like abilities, gaze attacks, poison, and acid. Slain foes are either left in the \"care\" of his minions or taken to Xaphan and used to stoke the hellish furnaces that power <i>Malefacta</i>.</p><p>Servants of Lucifer Followers of Lucifer are far and wide and consist of evil humanoids; usually clerics, necromancers, sorcerers, and wizards. Devout followers of Lucifer are called Dark Cardinals and must sign a pact of evil with Lucifer. Dark Cardinals can receive spells from Lucifer and are granted access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Strength, and War.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Daemonic, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Infernal, Sylvan, Terran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Lucifer plus 2-4 pit fiends)", "Ref": "37", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(51d10+663)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 38, Dex 26, Con 36, Int 28, Wis 28, Cha 34", "Gear": "Rod of Infernus, Hell's Redoubt", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2515, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Bleeding Critical, Cleave, Combat Casting, Craft Rod, Craft Wondrous Item, Critical Focus, Deceitful, Empower Spell, Extend Spell, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Improved Vital Strike, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Maximize Spell, Multiattack, Persuasive, Power Attack, Quicken Spell, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (fireball), Scribe Scroll, Sickening Critical, Silent Spell, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (trident)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "32", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Bluff, +4 Diplomacy, +4 Sense Motive", "AC": "74, touch 38, flat-footed 66", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lucifer", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +59, Appraise +60, Bluff +74, Diplomacy +74, Disguise +70, Fly +64, Intimidate +70, Knowledge (arcana) +60, Knowledge (planes) +63, Knowledge (religion) +63, Perception +67, Sense Motive +71, Stealth +58, Survival +60, Use Magical Device +63", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "38", "Race": "", "CR": "39", "XP": 209920000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Infernus)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "planar omniscience", "Saves": "Fort +32, Ref +37, Will +38", "Melee": "Huge +6 trident +71/+66/+61/+56 (3d6+28), bite +62 (2d8+7 plus 1d8 acid), sting +62 (2d8+7 plus poison) or 2 claws +64 (2d6+14 plus 1d8 acid), bite +64 (2d8+14 plus 1d8 acid), sting +62 (2d8+7 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft., fly 80 ft.
