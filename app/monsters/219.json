This gas cloud persists for 1 round; any creature within the area when the golem creates it (as well as any creature that passes through the cloud during the remainder of that round) is exposed to the cloud's poisonous effects. This poison is magically created each time the golem uses this power. Breath weapon-inhaled; save Fort 19; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5><h5><b> Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> An iron golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance.

If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. An iron golem gets no saving throw against fire effects. <br> An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.</h5><h5><b> Powerful Blows (Ex)</b> An iron golem inflicts one and a half times its Strength modifier and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>An iron golem has a humanoid body made from iron. It can be sculpted into any shape its creator desires, but it almost always displays armor of some sort, from simple and utilitarian to ceremonial and ornate.
