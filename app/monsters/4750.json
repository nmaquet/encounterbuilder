Hunting occurs whenever the bloodworm is hungry-day or night. A bloodworm's lair is beneath the ground, usually in soft earth near the shoreline of lakes and streams. A typical lair is at least as deep as the bloodworm is long and terminates in a large round chamber. Here the bloodworm dine on captured prey and spawn during mating season. Bloodworms mate during the late summer months. Young are born alive and kept wet by secretions from the larger bloodworms as well as water from nearby lakes and rivers. The young do not hunt yet and are cared for by the adults. Within a few months the young are strong enough to fend for themselves and do so, going out on their own. Bloodworms are pale and slightly pink in color. They can grow to a length of 40 feet or more, though most average about 12-15 feet long. The red stripes seen along its body are actually a combination of its bodily fluids and the fluids of recently devoured prey flowing through the creature. A bloodworm lies in wait for its prey, most often just beneath the silt and sand near shorelines. When it detects a potential meal, the bloodworm lunges from its hiding spot, striking with its extended proboscis. Slain prey is dragged into its lair and devoured.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d8+18)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 10, Con 17, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4750, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 9, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Bloodworm", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Swim +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm coastlines and underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +2, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +8 (2d6+7 plus bleed)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., burrow 10 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
