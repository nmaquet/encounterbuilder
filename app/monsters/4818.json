Elementals receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day. Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control, obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals. Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma check to gain control of the elemental. </h5><h5><b>Earth Glide (Ex)</b> Onyst can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, he can even glide through lava. His burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of his presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell cast on an area containing him flings him back 30 feet, stunning him for 1 round unless he succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. </h5><h5><b>Earth Mastery (Ex)</b> Onyst gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both he and his foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, Onyst takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether Onyst is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Onyst makes his home in a gigantic complex of caverns hollowed into the side of an enormous mountain of stone on the Plane of Earth. He is constantly attended by various earth elementals, stone giants, and xorn. He has a blue dragon of advanced age; some say the dragon serves as advisor and counsel, others say it is nothing more than a pet. In battle, Onyst likes to pound his foes with his enormous fists. Creatures that prove meddlesome are turned to stone and then pulverized, their remains scattered to the winds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Auran, Common, Ignan, Terran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or band (Onyst plus 2-4 greater earth elementals)", "Ref": "24", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(40d10+440)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 49, Dex 14, Con 32, Int 20, Wis 22, Cha 22", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4818, "SubType": "(earth, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Critical Focus, Dodge, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Bull Rush, Greater Overrun, Greater Sunder, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (slam), Improved Overrun, Improved Sunder, Improved Vital Strike, Iron Will, Lunge, Power Attack, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "Lord Of Earth Elementals", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "35", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "37, touch 11, flat-footed 34", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Onyst", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +62, Diplomacy +46, Intimidate +46, Knowledge (arcana) +48, Knowledge (dungeoneering) +48, Knowledge (planes) +48, Knowledge (religion) +45, Perception +49, Sense Motive +49, Stealth +37, Survival +49", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "21", "Race": "", "CR": "24", "XP": 1230000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Earth)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +35, Ref +24, Will +21", "Melee": "2 slams +58 (4d8+19/19-20)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., burrow 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
