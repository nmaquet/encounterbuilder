It stands on four stirge-like hind legs and grasps with its humanlike forelimbs, which end in chitinous claw-like fingers. It has the wings of a stirge, though wrinkled and seemingly useless. Its stirge-like head has distinctly human features and is topped with a bristled, backswept mane. Its mouth is tiny and filled with fangs, though its nose is long and sharp and is used to pierce and draw blood.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Stirge Demon</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 10</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>9,600</h5><h5>CE Large outsider (chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+3; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +21</h5><h5><b>Aura </b>drone (60 ft., DC 20). fear (20 ft., DC 16)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>23, touch 12, flat-footed 20 (+3 Dex, +11 natural, -1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>92 (8d10+48)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+12, <b>Ref </b>+9, <b>Will </b>+6</h5><h5><b>DR </b>10/good; <b>Immune </b>electricity and poison; <b>Resist </b>acid 10, cold 10, fire 10; <b>SR </b>21</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>20 ft., fly 60 ft.

All creatures within a 60-foot spread that hear it must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or fall into a comatose <i>sleep</i> for 1d4 hours. There is no HD limit for this effect and it otherwise functions as the <i>sleep</i> spell (CL 10th). Note, the stirge demon can drain blood from a <i>sleep</i>ing creature without automatically waking it up. In such an event, the <i>sleep</i>ing creature receives a new Will save (same DC) each round the stirge demon drains blood. The save DCs are Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>One of the most foul and despicable of all demonkind, the stirge demon hates all other demonic races and usually attacks them on sight. It savors the blood of vrocks and hezrous, but generally avoids any more powerful demonic races. Stirge demons play no role in the Abyssal armies as most demon lords and princes find them hard to control and consider them pests to be exterminated. Other demons loathe them as well, and usually attack them when they are encountered.</p><p>A stirge demon is about 10 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.</p><p>Stirge demons enter combat and attempt to drone as many of their opponents to <i>sleep</i> as they can. Creatures that resist are attacked with claws and bite. Once the stirge demon has droned all its opponents to <i>sleep</i>, or they have fled, it feasts on any <i>sleep</i>ing creatures, draining their blood. If outnumbered or overmatched, a stirge demon does not engage an enemy. If confronted by foes more powerful than it, the stirge demon uses its <i>greater teleport</i> to escape.</p><p>Credit The Stirge demon is loosely based on the Chasme Demon, which originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.
