Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If a clockwork swarm takes damage from an area attack, it is unable to repair itself for 1d6 rounds following the attack. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects) until it has at least 1 hit point (at which time it begins to self-repair at its normal rate of 3 hit points per round).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Clockwork swarms are a collection of tiny, insect-like clockworks that work together as a single creature. An individual member of the swarm poses little threat. Yet when acting in concert, a swarm poses a deadly threat to adventurers. Much like the clockwork warrior, the clockwork swarm forms a fighting frame from random pieces of trash, debris, and other cast-offs. The swarm, however, is much more capable of adapting to new situations and surviving combat. Unless the individual components of the swarm are destroyed, it simply reforms and continues its attack.</p><p>Area of effect attacks, such as burning oil, <i>fireball</i>, or <i>lightning bolt</i> are the most effective means of destroying the swarm. A clockwork swarm typically appears as a ramshackle collection of spare parts and garbage draped in a thick, web-like substance and arranged in a vaguely humanoid form.</p><p>A swarm prefers to lie in wait and strike from ambush, collecting innocuous looking piles of debris that adventurers overlook as harmless but that the swarm is capable of quickly forming into a combat-worthy frame. If the swarm attempts to assemble itself from a pile of debris, assume that the swarm starts the round with -10 hit points and self-repairs from there.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "squad (2-4 swarms)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 15, Con -, Int -, Wis 13, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2316, "SubType": "(swarm)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth when not moving", "AC": "18, touch 14, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Clockwork Swarm", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Stealth +2 (+6 when not moving)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +3, Will +2", "Melee": "swarm (1d6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Tiny"}
