Reclusive and strange creatures, vouivres prey on hapless travelers who stumble upon their choice bathing spots or unfortunate explorers who venture too close to their lairs. A vouivre always appears as an attractive woman from the waist up, but the curve of her hips leads to a thick, reptilian body ending in a dragon's head. While variations exist between individual creatures, a vouivre usually has fair skin and dark hair, at least on its humanoid portion. The draconic half of one of these strange monsters always possesses greenhued scales, gradually shifting from dull olive to radiant emerald shades as the creature ages. A typical vouivre is over 12 feet long from head to head, and weighs about 500 pounds.<b></p><p>Ecology</b><br></br> Vouivres make their homes in small caves near slowmoving rivers, placid lakes, and gurgling streams. There they keep their treasured items and frequently bathe in the soothing waters, preying on anyone who strays too close to the water's edge. Vouivres prefer to capture and eat humanoid males, but will feed on any available warmblooded prey when hungry. Rarely, a vouivre selects humanoid females as its primary prey, usually frequent bathers or washerwomen visiting a nearby brook. After devouring a humanoid, a vouivre can forgo a meal for 2 months before needing to feed again.</p><p>Vouivres breed in a unique manner. Living as celibates, these creatures reproduce asexually, only producing a new specimen after death. This bizarre process is more akin to a form of cloning than actual reproduction, leading some scholars to conjecture that only a fixed number of these creatures exist in the world simultaneously. After a vouivre dies, its dragon head disgorges a glassy, rubytinted sphere that serves as an egg of sorts. Beginning 1 week after death, this egg begins growing, eventually reaching a diameter of 2 feet, while its gleaming luster dims to a clouded, dull red. After 6 weeks, the gem splits, giving birth to a vouivre hatchling that must find a suitable secluded sanctuary and begin feeding itself from nearby resources.</p><p>This immature form remains hidden for years, slithering through obscuring muck and feeding on waterfowl and swimming rodents, until it reaches adult size, fully grown and ready to hunt its favorite prey.</p><p>While not a complete replica of its mother, a vouivre inherits traits and characteristics of its parent's meals throughout its lifetime. A vouivre understands this and thus seeks out handsome and formidable targets for its meals, hoping to pass down the best possible traits to its eventual offspring. A vouivre lives for roughly 200 years, barring any violent end, and matures from hatchling to adult in 7 years.</p><p>All vouivres have a singular relationship with sound.</p><p>As it desires, and especially when slithering seductively toward a victim, a vouivre can vibrate its scales, producing a haunting hum that excites the water around it in a strange, rippling harmony. A vouivre uses this sound as the basis for many of its spell-like abilities, accompanying the effects with song and seductive oratory. When a vouivre grows agitated, this low drone can reach a crescendo of ear-shattering noise, or become an insinuating resonance that turns trusted companions against each other.</p><p>Habitat and Society Solitary almost to the point of xenophobia, vouivres rarely meet. These creatures make their lairs far away from one another, and considering their unique style of reproduction, a single lineage can prey upon a particular region for centuries.</p><p>Although vouivres live in isolation from other intelligent creatures, they possess an afinity for serpents. Snakes of all kinds find themselves drawn to vouivres, with vipers and constrictors frequently found slithering among the scattered treasure in a vouivre's lair. Those fortunate few who have survived an encounter with a vouivre often report snakes assisting in the attack. Sages speculate that the delicate vibrations produced by a vouivre's scales enchant the serpents into this service.</p><p>Vouivres get along well with evil fey living near their lairs and sometimes even go so far as to share trinkets and gems from their hoards in return for mutual protection and companionship. Nefarious nixies, sinister selkies, and other waterborne fey particularly find places within a powerful vouivre's entourage. While they all have their own diverse hunting grounds, these companions meet regularly to share stories and even meals.</p><p>Though savage and bestial, vouivres have a love for material items. Gold jewelry, loose coins, finely cut gems, lavish decorations, and fine silks lie about their lairs. Vouivres covet this treasure and arrange the glittering goods in pleasing configurations, whimsically shifting the items around and redecorating as they please. These creatures constantly barter and trade, and demand payment from victims who beg for their lives.</p><p>Frequently, vouivres use their treasure as a way to lure unsuspecting travelers close, placing the bait among the reeds near the water's edge to catch the glint of the sun. As victims come to claim their found prize, the vouivre reveals its humanoid half while its dragon head lies unseen in the water below.</p><p>Vouivres prefer intelligent humanoids as prey, to hunt, toy with, and eventually eat. Adept at charm, deception, and trickery, vouivres rarely attack their prey directly, instead preferring to engage their victims in conversation before attacking unexpectedly. In combat, a vouivre's dragon head begins by roaring forth with a gout of flame before biting foes. With prey in its mouth, the dragon head can lock its jaws in place, holding a creature fast in its backward-curving teeth as the vouivre swims to deeper waters to drown its victim before bringing it back to its treasure-strewn cave for a satisfying meal.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "AP 30", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or harem (1 vouivre and 4-10 snakes)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d10+64)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 13, Con 18, Int 11, Wis 14, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 507, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Critical Focus, Deafening Critical, Great Fortitude, Improved Critical (claw), Improved Initiative, Improved Natural Attack (bite), Iron Will, Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception", "AC": "27, touch 10, flat-footed 26", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Vouivre", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +19, Fly +6, Intimidate +19, Perception +19, Sense Motive +14, Stealth +16, Swim +20", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "14", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests, lakes, and rivers", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +11, Will +14; +4 vs. mind-affecting effects", "Melee": "bite +19 (2d6+4 plus grab), 2 claws +20 (1d8+4/19-20), 2 wings +14 (1d6+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 40 ft.
