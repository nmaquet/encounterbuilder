The creature makes its home on the bottom of rivers and lakes, but spends most of its time near the shore where it attempts to lure fishermen, children, and sometimes even animals to their watery graves. Though it can sustain itself on a diet of seaweed, kelp, and various underwater plants, the peg powler prefers the taste of flesh and blood. Stories told, perhaps only to scare children, speak of swarms of peg powlers journeying far inland when their shoreline food supplies run scarce. These stories tell of entire villages being destroyed and every single inhabitant devoured by the ravenous peg powler swarm. Peg powlers tolerate the presence of sea hags, but there is no love lost between the two races. Stories speak of some peg powlers enjoying the taste of a sea hag's flesh over that of any other creature. This doesn't sit well with sea hags who have heard this tale. A peg powler appears as an emaciated woman with sickly green skin wearing tattered rags. Her hair, wild and unkempt, is usually brown or black. Her eyes are gray and appear almost pupiless. A typical peg powler stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds. A peg powler attacks with its claws, attempting to grab its foe, and drag it into its watery lair. A favored tactic of the peg powler is to hide near the riverbanks, grab an unsuspecting foe as it passes by, and then drag it into the water where it is drowned.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+16)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 16, Con 18, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5026, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Bluff", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Peg Powler", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +10, Intimidate +9, Perception +9, Stealth +13, Swim +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious, sound mimicry (voices)", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +7, Will +6", "Melee": "2 claws +8 (1d6+4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
