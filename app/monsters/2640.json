Any creature viewing the gloomwing from above must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be confused for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Implant Egg (Ex)</b> As a standard action, a female gloomwing can lay eggs inside a slain creature of Small or larger size. The young emerge about 2 weeks later as a tenebrous worms (see that entry), literally devouring the host from inside. While implanted, a body cannot be <i>raised</i> or <i>resurrected</i> except by the casting of a <i>true resurrection</i>, <i>wish</i>, or <i>miracle</i>, If <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> is cast on the body, the eggs are destroyed and the body can be <i>raised</i> normally. </h5><h5><b>Pheromone Call (Ex)</b> Each round a gloomwing emits its weakness pheromone there is a 20% chance that 1d4 additional gloomwings arrive in the area and join the battle. This is not a summoning spell or spell-like ability; the gloomwings can detect the pheromone and are automatically drawn to it. </h5><h5><b>Weakness Pheromone (Ex)</b> After the first round of combat, a gloomwing can emit a scent in a 30-foot radius as a free action that deals 1d2 points of Strength damage to any living, non-vermin creature (except gloomwings) in the area. An affected creature can make a successful DC 13 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area to negate the effects. On a successful save, that creature cannot be affected again by the same gloomwing's weakness pheromone for 24 hours. The pheromone ceases when the gloomwing dies. Strength damage dealt by a gloomwing's pheromone <i>heal</i>s faster than normal (1 point per hour rather that 1 point per night of rest). The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The gloomwing is native to the Plane of Shadow and is often summoned to the Material Plane by spellcasters to act as a guardian. On occasion, a gloomwing slips through a tear in the fabric of the planes and enters the Material Plane on its own.</p><p>The gloomwing is the adult stage of the tenebrous worm (see that entry). Female gloomwings lay their eggs in the bodies of slain victims.</p><p>In 12 days, these eggs hatch, releasing 4-10 tenebrous worms. The ivory mandibles of a gloomwing can be pried or broken from its carcass and sold for 100 gp each.</p><p>Gloomwings are aggressive creatures and fight from the air. They hover and flitter about an opponent, biting with their mandibles and slashing with their claws (they attack only with their two front claws; the other claws are too weak to be effective in combat). After the first round of combat, a gloomwing secretes a pheromone that calls other gloomwings in the area to its aid. The pheromone also acts as a weakening agent against non-insect creatures in the area.</p><p>Credit The Gloomwing originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+5)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 11, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2640, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Hover, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth to hide in dim light or darkness", "AC": "19, touch 12, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gloomwing", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +6, Perception +8, Stealth +6 (+10 in dim light or darkness)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Plane of Shadow", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "implant egg", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +7 (1d6), bite +7 (1d8)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., fly 40 ft.
