To the onlooker, it appears as if the drelb is retreating. Creatures succeeding on a DC 20 Will save see through this illusion; otherwise, the drelb advances into melee range and its opponent is considered flat-footed for the drelb's next attack following the use of this ability. A creature that has seen a drelb use this ability before gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +5 racial bonus. </h5><h5><b>Nether Chill (Su)</b> A living creature touched by a drelb must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or immediately drops anything it is holding and fall prone, shivering for 1 round. It is not helpless but is unable to make any actions during this round. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus for the drelb's Ability Focus feat. </h5><h5><b>Psionic Adaptation (Su)</b> A drelb can imitate any psionic power or psi-like ability used within 30 feet of it as a standard action. A drelb has a manifester level of 5th. The save DC (if any) to resist an imitated psionic power or psi-like ability is 12 + the level of the power. The save DC is Charisma-based. Further, any psionic power or psi-like ability that directly targets a drelb is reflected back on the attacker with full effect (manifester level and save DC equal to that of the original manifester).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Drelbs are energy creatures that make their home on the Negative Energy Plane. They are summoned to the Material Plane by evil spellcasters who task them with the duty of guarding treasure or secret places to be left alone. Hence, they are sometimes referred to as haunting custodians. A drelb resembles and is nearly indistinguishable from a wraith (DC 25 Perception check to notice the difference from a distance of 10 feet or more). Drelbs are not undead and cannot be turned, though they sometimes feign being affected, using their illusory retreat ability to trick their opponents.</p><p>A drelb attacks by touching an opponent with its incorporeal touch. It uses its illusory retreat ability at the first chance, attempting to catch an opponent unaware.</p><p>Credit The Drelb originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Daemonic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2549, "SubType": "(extraplanar, incorporeal, psionic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (nether chill), Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 15, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Drelb", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +11, Intimidate +11, Knowledge (the planes) +10, Perception +11, Sense Motive +11, Stealth +12, Survival +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "psionic adaptation", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +8, Will +7", "Melee": "incorporeal touch +9 (1d4 plus nether chill)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., fly 20 ft.
