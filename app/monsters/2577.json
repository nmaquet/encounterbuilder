The construct can <i>dispel magic</i>al fire it touches as <i>dispel magic</i> (caster level equal's the elemental construct's HD). </h5><h5><b>Engulf (Ex)</b> A water elemental construct can simply engulf Large or smaller creatures in its path as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The water elemental construct merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the construct, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 36 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed- on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the construct moves forward. Engulfed creatures are in danger of suffocating, and are trapped within its body until they are no longer pinned. The save DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> A water elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A <i>control water</i> spell or cold effect slows a water elemental construct for 2d6 rounds with no saving throw. A <i>horrid wilting</i> spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to a water elemental construct. The elemental construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 18 + caster's relevant ability modifier) for half damage. A <i>create water</i> spell heals 1d4 points of damage on the construct for each 2 gallons of water created. </h5><h5><b>Water Mastery (Ex)</b> A water elemental construct gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental construct is touching the ground, the elemental construct takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Water elemental constructs are rare elemental constructs (perhaps as rare or rarer than fire elemental constructs) found in the palaces of the Water Elemental Princes or in the service of a powerful spellcaster or water deity. The are usually given the task of keeping secret or guarding an area underwater as this is their native environment and they do not function well outside of it.</p><p>A water elemental construct is a humanoid, 9 feet tall, composed of water. No discernable features can be seen on its head, though sometimes the face of an elemental spirit seems to appear randomly somewhere on its form.</p><p>A water elemental construct crashes down on its opponents with watery fists before attempting to grab a foe and stuff it into its watery form. An engulfed foe is held until it drowns; thereafter, the elemental construct expels the creature's corpse onto the ground.</p><p>Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like any other automaton follows any order or command given to it to the best of its ability.</p><p>An elemental construct's creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct's creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the elemental construct under someone else's control, and so on), but the elemental construct's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone.</p><p>Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is composed entirely of its native element.</p><p>Construction An elemental construct's body is formed completely of one of the four elements air, earth, fire, or water. The materials must be the finest quality or purest form taken from the respective plane and mixed with rare oils, powders, and other ingredients totaling 5,000 gp.</p><p></h5><h5><b>ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCT CL </b>17th; </h5><h5><b>Price </b>200,000 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct (see the Bestiary), <i>geas/ quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, two spells of 4th level or higher with the appropriate elemental descriptor, creator must be caster level 17th; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Craft (sculptures) DC 20; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>102,500 gp Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "17", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(30d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 33, Dex 24, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2577, "SubType": "(elemental, extraplanar, water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "27, touch 15, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Water Elemental Construct", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Swim +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Plane of Water", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +17, Will +10", "Melee": "2 slams +39 (2d8+11)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 120 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
