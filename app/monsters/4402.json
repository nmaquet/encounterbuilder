Whenever a warm-blooded creature comes in direct physical contact with a grimple, there is a 25% chance it contracts gremlin lice. 1d4 rounds after the individual contracts lice, it begins to itch. The itch proves so distracting that for the duration of the infestation, the individual takes a -1 penalty on all concentration and initiative checks. Fortunately, these annoying parasites cannot live long on non-gremlins, and only survive for 24 hours. Submersion in water or exposure to freezing temperatures also kills a goblin lice infestation. </h5><h5><b>Putrid Vomit (Ex)</b> Every 1d4 rounds, a grimple can spit up a 30-foot stream of vomit as a standard action. Treat the vomit as a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Anyone struck by the vomit must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The save is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Grimples are filthy urban scavengers that lurk beneath the eaves of abandoned buildings, clock towers, belfries, and steeples. Sickly-looking and hideously ugly, they shed constantly as a result of the small parasites they host. Quick climbers, grimples also have loose flaps of skin that stretch between their arms and legs that they use to glide short distances. Like most gremlins, they despise humans and show their vengeance by attacking drunks, unlocking stables, torturing guard dogs, urinating in water barrels, and loosening hanging storefront signs so they fall on people. Still, the grimple's ability to vomit at will remains its most unappealing quality. Voracious omnivores, grimples feast off garbage. They frequently target inns, restaurants, and other places where they can scavenge a steady supply of food.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Undercommon", "Source": "Fey Revisited", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, mob (3-8), or infestation (9-16 with 1-3 rogues of 1st-3rd level, 1 fighter leader of 2nd-4th level, 2-6 trained dire rats and 1-4 spider swarms)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(1d6+1)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 3, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rock +3 (1d2-4)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4402, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Stealth), Weapon FinesseB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "13, touch 13, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Grimple", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +13, Fly +1, Perception +4, Sleight of Hand +5, Stealth +16, Swim +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "1/3", "XP": 135, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any urban", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "gremlin lice", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +3, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +3 (1d3-4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., climb 20 ft., fly 20 ft.
