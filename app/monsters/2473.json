Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising and resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a <i>wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>true resurrection</i> spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. A ghaddar advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a ghaddar devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements normally. The ghaddar only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. </h5><h5><b>Vorpal Bite (Ex)</b> If a ghaddar scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with its bite attack and confirms the critical hit, it severs the foe's head.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The terrible and mighty ghaddars roam the planes of Hell devouring the unfortunate souls of those they encounter. They also consume the essence and being of any outcast devils and dukes that cross their path.</p><p>A typical ghaddar stands 15 feet tall and weighs 6,000 pounds.</p><p>A ghaddar assails its foes with a barrage of claw attacks. A grabbed opponent is bitten and, if slain, devoured. Ghaddar are not strategists, and unless directed by a commander or captain, they attack with little organization and finesse. The ferocity of the ghaddar is unparalleled in combat.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (2-4)", "Ref": "15", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d10+112)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 33, Dex 21, Con 24, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2473, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "33, touch 13, flat-footed 28", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ghaddar Devil", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +30, Intimidate +23, Knowledge (planes) +20, Perception +25, Sense Motive +25, Stealth +16, Survival +21", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "12", "Race": "", "CR": "16", "XP": 76800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Hell)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +15, Will +12", "Melee": "2 claws +26 (2d6+11 plus grab), bite +25 (2d8+11 plus vorpal bite)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Huge"}
