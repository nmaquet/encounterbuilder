A typical underground lair is a large rocky cave while those living aboveground dwell beneath the sand and earth. Dune horrors sustain themselves on a diet of plants such as mosses or cacti and meat, such as preferring larger animals and humanoids, including giants to other sources of meat. A typical dune horror is 20 feet long with a light brown carapace. Its legs and claws are dark brown, growing darker near the ends. Its tail is dark brown as well, and the stinger black. The dune horror's serpentine neck is covered in light brown scales and its eyes are ruby-colored. Males and females are indistinguishable from one another, save the females are sometimes smaller. A typical female dune horror lays 2-16 eggs once every few years, with the eggs usually hatching 90-100 days later. Juvenile dune horrors are dark brown in color and are blind for the first month of their life. They mature rapidly, reaching adulthood within 6 months. Dune horrors generally live for 20 years. Dune horrors prefer to attack from ambush, often hiding just beneath the surface waiting for prey to come close. When prey is detected, the dune horror springs to the attack, rending its prey with its claws, stinging it with its deadly stinger, and biting it with its serpentine fanged maw. Grabbed prey is stung to death and devoured. Dune horrors do not collect treasure; any treasure found within its lair is the remnants of a previous meal.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d10+80)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 31, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4810, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (bite), Weapon Focus (sting), Weapon Focus (claw)B", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "17", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Climb, +8 Perception, +8 Stealth", "AC": "24, touch 8, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Dune Horror", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +14, Perception +21, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm deserts", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +17, Ref +10, Will +7", "Melee": "2 claws +25 (1d8+10 plus grab), bite +25 (2d6+10/19- 20 plus poison), sting +25 (1d8+10 plus poison)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., burrow 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
