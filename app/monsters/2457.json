Its head is hairless and features four downward-curving horns jutting just above its forehead. The two lower horns are smaller than the topmost horns. A ridge of small spines runs from the creature's brow down the center of its head and tapers off just below its shoulder blades. Its hands end in razor-sharp talons and its eyes are sapphire blue.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Beluiri</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 15</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>51,200</h5><h5>CE Medium outsider (chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+7; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., <i>true seeing</i>; Perception +36</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>40, touch 25, flat-footed 32 (+7 Dex, +1 dodge, +15 natural, +7 profane)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>184 (16d10+96)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+16, <b>Ref </b>+14, <b>Will </b>+17</h5><h5><b>DR </b>15/cold iron and good; <b>Immune </b>electricity, poison; <b>Resist </b>acid 10, cold 10, fire 10; <b>SR </b>26</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>40 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>2 claws +22 (1d6+6 plus poison)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>5 ft.; <b>Reach </b>5 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>dominating gaze, seduction</h5><h5><b>Spell-Like Abilities</b> (CL 20th)</br>Constant&mdash;<i>true seeing</i></br>At Will&mdash;<i>blasphemy</i> (DC 24), <i>charm monster</i> (DC 21), <i>deeper darkness</i>, <i>desecrate</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect law</i>, <i>fear</i> (DC 21), <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>tongues</i> (self only), <i>unhallow</i></br>3/day&mdash;<i>greater dispel magic</i>, <i>suggestion</i> (DC 20), <i>wall of fire</i></br>1/day&mdash;<i>fire storm</i> (DC 24), <i>wail of the banshee</i> (DC 26), summon (level 9, 1d4 hezrous or 1d4 gharros demons, 100%)</h5></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>22, <b>Dex </b>24, <b>Con </b>22, <b>Int </b> 20, <b>Wis </b>20, <b>Cha </b>24</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+16; <b>CMB </b>+22; <b>CMD </b>47</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Ability Focus (seduction), Alertness, Blind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Deceitful, Dodge, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Acrobatics +18, Bluff +30, Diplomacy +26, Disguise +27, Escape Artist +18, Intimidate +26, Knowledge (arcana) +21, Knowledge (planes) +24, Perception +36, Sense Motive +28, Stealth +26, Survival +21; <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+8 Perception</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Goblin, Infernal</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any (Abyss)</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary or troupe (Beluiri plus 1d4 hezrous or 1d4 gharros demons)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>double standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Dominating Gaze (Su)</b> Three times per day, 30 feet, DC 25 Will save or dominated as per the <i>dominate person</i> spell (CL 20th).

She is known throughout the Abyss as the Temptress, for in her many disguises she has seduced countless princes, lords, and generals of the Abyss. In the end, she most often betrays those that fall victim to her wiles. She is hated for this by more than one noble or lord of the Abyss. She sometimes journeys to the Material Plane (in one of her many guises) to tempt and seduce mortals, for she knows that all mortals, in their hearts, always give in to their true desires-be it power, greed, lust, or one of many countless other sins.</p><p>Beluiri rarely wears clothing, but at times when she does, she enjoys gowns and robes of gold, white, and red.</p><p>Beluiri prefers subterfuge rather than directly assaulting an opponent.</p><p>She usually alters her appearance to appear as an attractive member of a potential victim's race; once the victim is lured in, she assumes her true form and attacks. If combat goes against her, she flees, but only after summoning lesser demons to cover her escape and kill her opponents.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Goblin, Infernal", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Beluiri plus 1d4 hezrous or 1d4 gharros demons)", "Ref": "14", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d10+96)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 24, Con 22, Int 20, Wis 20, Cha 24", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2457, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (seduction), Alertness, Blind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Deceitful, Dodge, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "16", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "40, touch 25, flat-footed 32", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Beluiri", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +18, Bluff +30, Diplomacy +26, Disguise +27, Escape Artist +18, Intimidate +26, Knowledge (arcana) +21, Knowledge (planes) +24, Perception +36, Sense Motive +28, Stealth +26, Survival +21", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "17", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +16, Ref +14, Will +17", "Melee": "2 claws +22 (1d6+6 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
