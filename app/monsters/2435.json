Creatures killed in this manner can only be restored to life by a <i>miracle</i>, <i>wish</i>, or <i>true resurrection</i> spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Choronzons are the demons of confusion, dispersion, and ultimate chaos. They are huge behemoths seemingly bred for war and battle, though most rarely take part in the Abyssal wars that rage between the planes. Choronzons prefer to use their talents on weak-minded creatures such as those that inhabit the Material planes, and as such, they are usually encountered there. These demons derive great pleasure in laying waste to villages and towns and even small kingdoms (if the mood strikes them).</p><p>Amongst demonkind, choronzons are both feared and hated. A great enmity exists between balors and choronzons that scholars and lorekeepers can document, but cannot determine the source of the hatred between these two demonic races.</p><p>A choronzon stands about 20 feet tall and weighs about 9,000 pounds.</p><p>Its scaly flesh is bluish-black and its eyes are crimson. Its horns are darker than the rest of its body and the creature's claws are pitch black. Its teeth are dull ivory in color.</p><p>A choronzon begins combat by surrounding itself with its aura of confusion and then unleashing its breath weapon at its foes. Creatures surviving either attack are subjected to its <i>word of chaos</i>. Opponents that continue to press the battle are met with a mix of physical attacks and spell-like abilities. When it uses its Power Attack feat, a choronzon usually takes a -8 penalty on its attack rolls in order to gain a +8 bonus on its damage rolls.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or band (choronzon plus 6-11 vrocks)", "Ref": "14", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(20d10+180)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 33, Dex 15, Con 29, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2435, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "23", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "32, touch 10, flat-footed 30", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Choronzon Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +27, Climb +34, Escape Artist +25, Intimidate +27, Perception +39, Sense Motive +25, Survival +22", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "18", "XP": 153600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +23, Ref +14, Will +10", "Melee": "bite +30 (2d8+11/19-20), 2 claws +29 (1d8+11 plus daze)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Huge"}
