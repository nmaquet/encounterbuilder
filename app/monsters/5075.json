A Stygian spawn's tongue is covered in sharpened barbs and any attempt to break free of a grapple with it, whether successful or not, deals an extra 1d6 points of piercing damage to the target. A Stygian spawn does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A Stygian spawn is a creature that lurks along the banks of the River Styx. Unlike amphibians on the Material Plane, Stygian spawn spend very little time in the water. Most of the time, these vile creatures reside deep in the mud in a self-induced state of hibernation. Stygian spawns only eat creatures not native to the lower planes; such creatures are the spawns' only source of food. Travelers in the realms of the lower planes quickly learn to fear the horrid Stygian spawn, which awaken from their hibernation and erupt from the mud of the River Styx with surprising speed. A Stygian spawn summoned to another plane is dangerous to all life there, since it can eat any organic substance that fits in its mouth. Occasionally, Stygian spawn are awakened on purpose by bored charonadaemons who hunt the creatures for sport. Stygian spawn tadpoles are harmless, and resemble pale, boneless fish that swim mindlessly in the River Styx. These tadpoles are a frequent source of food for hungry hydrodaemons. A fully-grown Stygian spawn is 20 feet long and weigh 3,000 pounds. Since their only source of food-extraplanar travelers-are so rare, Stygian spawn attack with their barbed tongue, trying to grapple and swallow their opponents as quickly as possible. In extended combats, however, a Stygian spawn blasts at opponents with its breath weapon.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Infernal", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pack (2-6)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(13d10+91)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 31, Dex 15, Con 24, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.
