Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and 10 hit points. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals 10 points of damage to the dracohydra's body. A dracohydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties. </h5><h5><b>Regenerate Head (Ex)</b> When a dracohydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. The heads are of the same color as the one that was severed. A dracohydra cannot have more than 10 heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage (after overcoming the dracohydra's resistances) must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A dracohydra doesn't die from losing its heads until all are cut off and the stumps seared by acid or fire. </h5><h5><b>Savage Bite (Ex)</b> A dracohydra applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Believed to be either the mating of a hydra and a dragon or the offspring of a draconic deity, the dracohydra is truly a fearsome monster. Most intelligent creatures do their best to avoid trespassing on a dracohydra's domain for these creatures are extremely territorial, even more so than some dragons. Dracohydras prefer lairing in remote locations such as mountaintops and ruins, far away from civilization and far away from adventurous treasure seekers. Dracohydras, while solitary, often make pacts with local humanoids; most often orcs, gnolls, and hobgoblins. Generally these pacts are lopsided deals that favor the dracohydra: give it food and it won't eat your village. Such food usually consists of herd animals or cattle, and sometimes humanoids if necessary to sate the dracohydra's voracious appetite. Humanoid sacrifices usually take the form of slaves or prisoners, but if either of those is in low numbers, tribes have been known to sacrifice their own to appease a dracohydra. Betraying their draconic origin, dracohydras amass treasure in great quantities. Most treasures are left strewn about the lair, but some, such as rare gemstones and small trinkets are devoured by dracohydras. Dracohydras do not associate with other dracohydras, hydras, or dragons. Hydras are particularly reviled for unknown reasons, and are attacked on sight and slaughtered, their bodies being almost completely devoured by a dracohydra. A dracohydra's body is usually dark gray or dark grayish-blue. Its dragon-like heads are scaled and vary in color blending into the body at the neckline. A dracohydra's eyes are always sapphire blue, regardless of the color of the dragon's head.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+50)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 12, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4791, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Lunge, Toughness, Weapon Focus (bite)B", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "20, touch 9, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Dracohydra", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +6, Perception +12, Swim +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "hydra traits, regenerate head", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +10, Will +5", "Melee": "5 bites +14 (2d6+5/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
