Extending down from its large head is a manlike torso and arms that again change into a long knot of feathery writhing tentacles which it uses as a means of propulsion beneath the waves. Its lower torso is a mass of writhing and twitching tentacles.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Sudoth</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 3</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>800</h5><h5>N Medium aberration (aquatic)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+3; <b>Senses </b>all-around vision, darkvision 60 ft., watersense 60 ft.; Perception +12</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>16, touch 13, flat-footed 13 (+3 Dex, +3 natural)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>26 (4d8+8)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+3, <b>Ref </b>+4, <b>Will </b>+5</h5><h5><b>DR </b>5/slashing or piercing</h5><h5><b>Weaknesses </b>Water dependant</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>5 ft., swim 30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>2 slam +7 (1d6+4), spear +7 (1d8+4), tentacle +5 (1d8+2 plus paralysis)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>5 ft.; <b>Reach </b>5 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>paralysis (1d6 rounds, DC 14)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>18, <b>Dex </b>16, <b>Con </b>14, <b>Int </b> 11, <b>Wis </b>12, <b>Cha </b>8</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+3; <b>CMB </b>+7; <b>CMD </b>20</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Multiattack, Swim-By Attack</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Perception +12, Stealth +10, Survival +8, Swim +19,; <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+4 Perception</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> temperate and warm aquatic</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary, gang (2-4), or school (5-8)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div></h5><h5><b>Water Dependent (Ex)</b> A sudoth can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning rules in Chapter 13 of the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core</i> Rulebook). </h5><h5><b>Watersense (Ex)</b> A sudoth can automatically pinpoint anything in contact with the water within 60 feet.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Sudoth are a curious species thought to be the offspring of sailors stranded in windless seas and some cursed horror of the deep. For this reason they are often attacked by mariners on sight. In truth, the sudoth are a peaceable if dangerous species that trade freely between locathah, sahaugin, and occasionally sea elves and merfolk. Their pliable flesh proves immune to the pressures of deep waters, allowing them to salvage riches from the depths that even other races of the seas find impossible to retrieve. They are enemies of krakens and aboleth who find them a delicious tasting delicacy.</p><p>Sudoths make their lairs deep under the oceans and sustain themselves on a diet of small fish and plant life. Hunters by nature, they often employ spears and nets when on a hunting excursion.</p><p>The fleshy parts of this creature vary in color from a milky white transparent color to a deep, rich bluish-green. Its tentacles range in color from gray to dark blue and vary in size with the sudoth (the larger specimen's tentacles reach lengths of 10 feet or more). A small almost unnoticeable band of eyes (the same color as its flesh) ring the circumference of its head.</p><p>Sudoth attack with weapons such as spears or with slam attacks. Their tail tentacles excrete a paralytic substance. A common tactic is to grapple and paralyze a foe with its tentacles, and finish them off with stabs from their spear.</p><p>Its malleable form protects it against most bludgeoning attacks; thus opponents are advised to employ piercing or slashing weapons when combating a sudoth.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-4), or school (5-8)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3042, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Multiattack, Swim-By Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Sudoth", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +12, Stealth +10, Survival +8, Swim +19,", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +4, Will +5", "Melee": "2 slam +7 (1d6+4), spear +7 (1d8+4), tentacle +5 (1d8+2 plus paralysis)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
