This gives it a +20 bonus on Stealth checks and the ability to hide in plain sight for 1 round per Hit Die even when there is no cover, concealment, or shadow nearby. If it makes an attack, the thin man is no longer in its vanished state. It usually uses this ability when attempting to elude pursuit.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The mysterious thin men of Nuat have long been a part of Rahadoumi legend. They inhabited their tiny island home long before human colonists first arrived, and the so-called thin men have lived on the periphery of Rahadoumi society or among the indigenous cane fields since times long forgotten. Their natural coloration and slender frames serve particularly well in concealing them from the prying eyes of suspicious humans. The thin men use their naturally hard and sharp claws to dig narrow burrows beneath the fields and copses of the island. Their bodies have few bones-instead, their skeletal frameworks are almost entirely cartilaginous in nature, which allows them to navigate their tiny burrows with relative ease and escape the notice of their human neighbors. Their close connection with the earth likewise gives them immunity to natural toxins. Though the thin men generally keep to themselves, only observing their human counterparts from the shadows, on occasion they tire of the meager fare of plant roots, grubs, and small vermin on which they normally subsist, and catch a local farmer alone in his fields or traveling at night. On these occasions, they murder the hapless victim and feast on his remains. Their uncanny ability to hide in the endless waving fields of cane lets them avoid the patrol of the Pure Legion or posse of vengeful farmers that comes around to search for the killer.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo", "Source": "Inner Sea Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or band (3-8)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d6+14)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 16, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.
