They are very flexible creatures, adapting easily to their climate and able to survive in all but the harshest of temperatures. Deer are very flexible in their diets as well, able to exist on plants, insects, fish, and even dead birds. Deer are excellent swimmers and have been known to swim to a distance of five miles in the water. These statistics represent the typical white-tailed deer; they can also be used to represent other deer-like animals such as caribou and antelope.</p><p>Deer attack with their hooves or antlers. Antelopes, when defending their herd, attack by charging an opponent and butting with their horns (gore). The gore attack only applies to bucks with antlers.<br><b>Black-Tailed Deer</b><br> The statistics above can be used to represent the average black-tailed deer as well, with a few minor changes. The black-tailed deer prefers plains, hills, and other open ground as its habitat. It has a +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks when jumping. In combat, a black-tailed deer jumps about in an effort to confuse its attackers before stotting (hopping) away.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, mated pair, herd (2-20)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3457, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "DodgeB, MobilityB, Run", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +4 Stealth (+8 in forests), +4 Swim", "AC": "14, touch 13, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Deer", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +2 (+6 jump), Perception +10, Stealth +10 (+14 in forests), Swim +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "1/4", "XP": 100, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +5, Will +2", "Melee": "gore +2 (1d6+1), 2 hooves -3 (1d4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
