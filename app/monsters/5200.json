It can resume or suspend this ability as a free action. </h5><h5><b>Speed Surge (Ex)</b> Three times per day as a swift action, a shadow drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round. </h5><h5><b>Stygian Breath (Su)</b> As a standard action, a shadow drake can exhale a ball of black liquid that explodes into a cloud of frigid black mist. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 12 half) to all creatures within a 5-foot-radius spread. The mist snuffs out light sources in the area effect, extinguishing nonmagical light sources and dispelling light spells of 1st level or lower. Once a shadow drake has used its stygian breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Shadow drakes are mischievous and greedy. They often use their whiplike tails as third limbs, grasping small objects or even using their tails to work locks or swipe small objects they desire. Because they are so small and fast, they are master thieves and pickpockets. Unlike most drakes and dragonkin, shadow drakes like to haunt the fringes of civilization, often making lairs in abandoned buildings, forgotten attics, or unused bell towers, and stashing their tiny treasure hoards there. A shadow drake can be chosen as a familiar by a 7th-level evil spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat. Young shadow drakes are almost pure black and have lustrous hides. As they age, their scales lose this luster and turn dull gray. Much like their larger dragon cousins, shadow drakes are long-lived, and can reach 150 to 200 years in age.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or rampage (3-5)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d12+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 9, Dex 20, Con 12, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "0 ft.
