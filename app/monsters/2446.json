Its skin is stretched tightly over its bones to the point that its underlying muscles can be seen clearly. Its skin is pale gray. Its hands end in long fingers tipped with razor-sharp talons. Its mouth is filled with tusk-like teeth, dominated by two overgrown tusks that jut upward from its bottom jaw. Its eyes glow with an eerie yellow light.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Nabasu Demonling</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 7</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>3,200</h5><h5>CE Medium outsider (chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+5; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +23</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>23, touch 11, flat-footed 22 (+1 Dex, +12 natural)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>73 (7d10+35)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+10, <b>Ref </b>+3, <b>Will </b>+8</h5><h5><b>DR </b>10/cold iron or good; <b>Immune </b>death effects, electricity paralysis, poison; <b>Resist </b>acid 10, cold 10, fire 10; <b>SR </b>18</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Living creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner transforms into a ghoul in 1d4 rounds under the control of the nabasu that created it. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the nabasu dies, any ghouls under its control become free-willed. </h5><h5><b>Plane Shift (Su)</b> Three times per day a nabasu demonling can shift to the Material Plane, and a mature nabasu can shift between the Abyss and the Material Plane or back. This transports the nabasu and up to six other creatures provided they all link hands with the nabasu. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (CL 10th for the demonling and CL 13th for the mature nabasu). </h5><h5><b>Feed (Su)</b> When a nabasu creates a ghoul with its gaze attack, it gains a growth point. It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, caster level checks, and skill checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 10 for each growth point it gains and its caster level increases by 1. For every 2 growth points, its natural armor bonus, SR, and CR increases by +1. Each time it gains a growth point, the nabasu demonling makes a DC 30 caster level check-success indicates it becomes a mature nabasu. At 10 growth points, a demonling automatically becomes a mature nabasu.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Nabasu (both plural and singular form) are one of the most malign of demonkind. They derive great pleasure from torturing and killing (albeit slowly) other creatures. Unlike other demons, a nabasu spends a portion of its life on the Material Plane. Those that reach the demonling stage in their growing process travel to the Material Plane where they feed on humanoids in order to continue their maturity. Once a nabasu reaches maturity, it returns to the Abyss to spend the rest of its immortal existence there.</p><p>A nabasu (demonling or mature) stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.</p><p>Nabasu prefer to attack with their claws and bite so they can watch their opponents die a slow and very painful death. A nabasu fights until either it or its opponent is dead, and it never shows mercy to an opponent in battle.</p><p>Credit The Nabasu originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, plus one more; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+35)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 13, Con 20, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2446, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception, +8 Stealth in shadowy areas", "AC": "23, touch 11, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Nabasu Demonling", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Escape Artist +11, Fly +11, Intimidate +12, Knowledge (arcana) +12, Knowledge (planes) +12, Perception +23, Sense Motive +9, Stealth +10 (+18 in shadowy areas), Survival +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "plane shift", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +3, Will +8", "Melee": "2 claws +11 (1d6+4), bite +11 (1d8+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.
