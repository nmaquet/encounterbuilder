In most cases where a nymph attempts to raise a forlarren child, it's only a matter of time before the forlarren grows resentful and its evil nature compels it to murder its mother.</p><p>Most forlarrens are female, and few are capable of conceiving children of their own. A forlarren grows to adulthood with astonishing speed, reaching full growth in only a year-even those who come into the world as orphans are capable of defending themselves and seeking out food. Yet despite the rapidity with which they reach maturity, few forlarrens survive to adulthood. Cast out from both sylvan and fiendish society, the typical forlarren is a lonely creature, cursed by its own existence. It detests itself and everything it sees, and soon becomes consumed by hatred of life itself. The forlarren vents its rage on good and evil alike, lashing out at anything that approaches it.</p><p>The forlarren attacks with its clawed hands, typically focusing on a single opponent at a time and attacking until it or its opponent is slain. Yet curiously, when a forlarren succeeds in killing an opponent, the kindly traits of its fey mother sometimes surface, and it shows profound remorse for its cruelty. With such a pendulum of erratic behavior, it is no wonder that forlarrens are all but incapable of forming lasting friendships-even with others of their own kind.</p><p>The majority of forlarrens inherit little in the way of the magical abilities possessed by their fey mothers, but they do gain a small measure of the powers of their fiendish fathers. In most cases, this manifests as the ability to use <i>heat metal</i> three times per day, but some forlarren instead gain a different spell-like ability chosen from the following list: <i>chill metal</i>, flame blade, flaming sphere, <i>gust of wind</i>, <i>summon swarm</i>, or <i>warp</i> wood.</p><p>A forlarren stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds.</p><p>In theory, these creatures can live for hundreds of years, but most perish through violence before they turn 10.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d6+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1223, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 12, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Forlarren", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +9, Perception +11, Stealth +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate plains or forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +6, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +4 (1d6+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
