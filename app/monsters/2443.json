Creatures meeting its gaze must make a successful DC 22 Will save or flee in fear for 1d6 rounds. On a successful save, that opponent is immune to the fear gaze of that mallor for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Foul Liquid (Su)</b> All liquids within 100 feet of a mallor automatically foul and become unsuitable for consumption or inhabitation (no save). Magical liquids in the area receive a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid the effects. Creatures drinking fouled water must make a successful DC 27 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 minute. Aquatic creatures (or those that can breathe water) swimming in fouled water must make a Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each round they remain in the area or begin suffocating. A mallor can foul up to 20 gallons of liquid a day using this ability. Sentient- or liquid-based creatures (such as water elementals) must make a successful DC 27 Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of Constitution damage each hour they remain in the area. At Constitution 0, the creature's liquid structure fouls and it dies. The save DCs are Constitution-based. A mallor can suppress or resume this ability at will as a free action. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Claw-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 27; <i>frequency</i> 1/ round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Strength; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Mallors are the creation of some long-forgotten (and presumably slain) demon lord who supposedly used dark and powerful magic to combine the best (and worst) traits of a demon with the best and worst traits of snakes.</p><p>Purportedly they were spawned from the same demonic force that created the dreaded marilith. Though originally only encountered on the lowest planes of the Abyss, the mallor's are quickly growing and they can now be found on just about any layer of that dreaded plane. Mallors are frequently encountered on the Material Plane in the service of powerful spellcasters seeking to gain some service from them. They disdain mortals, particularly mortal spellcasters, and seek to twist and manipulate them when given the chance. Binding a mallor is a dangerous thing, for if it manages to break free or twist the bargain to its favor, it most assuredly kills or captures the summoner and carries it back to the Abyss never to be seen again.</p><p>A mallor is a 10 to 12 feet long, powerful, humanoid with the lower torso of a giant coral snake. Its humanoid frame is crimson-colored while its snake body is black with bands of yellow and red. Its arms end in sharpened claws, slightly curved under, just enough to tear through flesh, sinew and muscle. Mallors have black, gold, or amber hair. Their eyes are white with red or green pupils.</p><p>A mallor is a straightforward combatant in battle and charges directly at its opponents. Normally, it opens battle with <i>burning hands</i> and/or its fear gaze in hopes of affecting as many targets as possible. The mallor then attempts to move to melee range and touch the nearest spellcaster while using its <i>touch of idiocy</i>. Multiple mallors work in concert with one another; one often drawing the fire away from the others so they can charge in with their massive spears.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, plus any three; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(14d10+140)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 27, Dex 15, Con 30, Int 16, Wis 16, Cha 20", "Gear": "+1 anarchic longspear", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2443, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, DeceitfulB, Cleave, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "21", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "29, touch 16, flat-footed 27", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mallor Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +26, Climb +25, Diplomacy +22, Disguise +7, Intimidate +22, Knowledge (planes) +20, Perception +28, Sense Motive +20, Stealth +15, Survival +20", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "poison use", "Saves": "Fort +21, Ref +11, Will +7", "Melee": "+1 anarchic longspear +22/+17/+12 (2d6+13/x3 plus poison) or 2 claws +21 (1d6+8 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.,", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
