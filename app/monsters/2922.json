Distrusted in times of peace, their savage warriors are sought out in times of war for their brutality and ferocity. Blood orc bands decorate their standards and shields with the scalps and severed heads of opponents and are known to drink flagons of putrid blood before entering battle. Blood orcs always fight to the death, take few prisoners, and offer no quarter to their foes. Blood orcs have a special hatred for black orcs whom they see as traitors to the orcish god Grotaag.</p><p>A typical male blood orc stands over 6 feet tall and weighs around 200 pounds or more. Females tend to be slightly lighter and smaller. Blood orcs skin is dark reddish-black and their hair is black, dark brown, or crimson (rare, but it does occur). Eye color is always black. Blood orcs favor armor and clothes of black or dark red.</p><p>Skilled in combat, blood orcs are ruthless opponents, attacking with weapons and savage bite. They swarm foes and are known for assaulting the center of enemy forces, overbearing defenders with their brutal attacks. Their most common tactic is to form a shield wall with heavy wooden shields. The front rows of attackers break enemy lines with battleaxes while the rear ranks attack with longspears and glaives.</p><p>Once melee is mixed and blood is in the air, the blood orcs drop both in favor of greataxes. When faced with magic-using opponents they spread themselves out to avoid being consumed by area of effect spells.<b></p><p>Blood Orc Society</b></p><p> Blood orcs are a primitive (even for orcs), barbaric race of people.</p><p>Hunters and nomads by nature, they rarely settle in one place for long being always on the move following any source of food. Blood orc tribes and villages tend to congregate near one another for protection, food, and various other needs. Most tribes or villages also situate themselves near an abundant source of water. Other orc tribes avoid the blood orc nations, seeing them as savages and primitives. Trade between the blood orcs and other races is rare though blood orcs do tend to favor the company of gnolls, flinds, and hobgoblins (why, no one knows).</p><p>Each tribe or village is let by an elder warrior, a barbarian of great strength and power. Each tribe also includes at least a single shaman or witch doctor who tends to the wounded, predicts the future, and so on.</p><p><br><b>Blood Orc Characters</b><br> Blood orc leaders tend to be barbarians. Blood orcs pay homage to Grotaag. Clerics have access to two of the following domains: Chaotic, Evil, Trickery, and War.</p><p><br><b>+8 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -4 Wisdom, -4 Charisma.</b> Blood orcs are brutal and savage.<br><b>Darkvision:</b> Blood orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br><b>Scent:</b> Blood orcs can detect enemies and other creatures by scent.<br><b>Ferocity Light Sensitivity Natural Weapons:</b> Blood orcs can make a bite (1d4) as a secondary attack.<br><b>Special Attacks:</b> Frenzy (see above).<br><b>Languages:</b> Blood orcs begin play speaking Common and Orc.
