These electrical flashes are used not only for attracting a mate, but also for luring in prey. Sparkstings are insectivores, and hunt by flying into a swarm of insects and flailing about with their tentacles. Electrocuted insects adhere to the tentacles, which the sparksting then draws into its mouth, located under its body. Sparkstings are asexual and reproduce by budding. Mating season for these creatures is every few months, and the number of spawn is controlled by the amount of readily available light. Newborn sparkstings have tiny tentacles and do not generate the electrical discharge adults do. The tentacles grow rapidly however, and within three months, the creature reaches adulthood. The typical lifespan of a sparksting is roughly 1 year. The sparksting has few natural predators: other sparkstings and a few larger insects seem to enjoy dining on these creatures. A sparksting is a tiny creature about 2 inches across. It consists of a membranous, fleshy bag with the consistency of egg yolk. Beneath the main body of a sparksting hang its tentacles, a fibrous mass that flickers with electrical arcs. Sparksting swarms cloud the air around any creature that disturbs them, attacking like angry bees. Some spellcasters have begun experimenting with using sparkstings as alternate spell components for <i>lightning bolt</i> spells and in the construction of shock-based magic weapons.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, flight (2-5), or cloud (6-12)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 3, Dex 18, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5079, "SubType": "(swarm)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Improved Lightning Reflexes, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 18, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sparksting Swarm", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +21, Perception +1", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +12, Will +5", "Melee": "swarm (2d6 electricity plus distraction)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., fly 40 ft.
