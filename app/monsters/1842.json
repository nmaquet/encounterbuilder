This acid often remains in their mouths and is transferred to a victim bitten by a larva. Any melee bite attack deals acid damage. </h5><h5><b>Maggot Spray (Ex)</b>: Once per day, an abyssal larva can regurgitate and fire a stream of maggots at a single opponent within 10 feet. This requires the abyssal larva to succeed on a ranged touch attack. If the attack succeeds, the opponent is sickened for 1d2 rounds. A successful DC 10 Reflex save reduces the sickened condition to 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Tortured Mind (Ex)</b>: The mind of an abyssal larva is a warped and tangled mass of chaos. As a result, abyssal larvae are immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). A creature attempting to contact an abyssal larva with a mind-affecting spell or effect (including psionics) must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be affected as by a <i>confusion</i> spell for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Abyssal larvae are believed to be the final form of an evil soul deemed too weak to become a demon and too weak to become the servant of a demon. Another theory suggests that the larvae are the imprisoned forms of slain demon princes and lords. Whatever their true origin, abyssal larvae are plentiful throughout the Abyssal planes, and are some of the most disgusting and loathsome creatures encountered.</p><p>These creatures feed on anything they can consume, be it rotting carcasses, freshly slain creatures, and even waste. Consumables are first liquefied through a process requiring the abyssal larva to regurgitate stomach acids onto its meal. As the food breaks down, the larva slurps it up and consumes it.</p><p>While loathed by the more civilized, some demons, such as dretches and babaus, savor the juicy flesh of these creatures and often engage in hunting expeditions across the Abyss, killing and devouring as many of these creatures as they can find.</p><p>Acting as if almost mindless, abyssal larvae attack any living creature they encounter. They have no real tactics other than swarming a foe and biting relentlessly. These creatures fight until destroyed.</p><p>An abyssal larva's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, is treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "mob (4-7), brood (8-17)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 3, Wis 10, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "maggot spray +1 (sickened)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1842, "SubType": "(chaotic, evil extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 10, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Abyssal Larva", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +4, Stealth +4", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "the Abyss", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "tortured mind", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +0", "Melee": "bite +1 (1d4 plus 1d4 acid)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
