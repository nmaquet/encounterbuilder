Sages contend that no other explanation is possible concerning this monster. Two-headed trolls prefer to make their lairs underground and away from civilization. Although believed to be the offspring of an ettin and troll, they do not associate with the former, but are often found leading the latter during raids or wars.</p><p>A two-headed troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Its hide is mottled green or gray, and its facial features resemble that of a standard troll. Two-headed trolls typically dress in rags or tattered clothes or even battered and rusted armor on occasion. Their legs end in three-toed feet, and their powerful arms end in sharpened claws.</p><p>The two-headed troll has the slow moving gait of the normal troll, but does not walk hunched over.</p><p>Two-headed trolls attack with two claws and two bites, though on occasion they have been known to wield longswords or clubs.<br><b>Two-Headed Troll Characters</b><br> Two-headed troll characters possess the following racial traits.<br><b>+12 Strength, +8 Constitution, -2 Intelligence (minimum 3), -4 Charisma.</b><br><b>Large size:</b> -1 penalty to Armor Class, -1 penalty on attack rolls, -4 penalty on Stealth checks, +1 bonus on CMB and CMD checks, lifting and carrying limits double those of Medium characters.<br><b>Space/Reach:</b> 10 feet/10 feet.<br><b>Darkvision:</b> Two-headed trolls can see in the dark out to 90 feet.<br><b>Low-light vision:</b> Two-headed trolls can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.<br><b>Scent:</b> Two-headed trolls can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell.<br><b>Racial Hit Dice:</b> A two-headed troll begins with ten levels of humanoid, which provide 10d8 Hit <br><b>Dice</b>, a base attack bonus of +7, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +7, Ref +3, and Will +3.<br><b>Racial Skills:</b> A two-headed troll's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 10 x (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1).
