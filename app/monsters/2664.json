They are aggressive hunters and dine on anything they can catch and kill.</p><p>Gray nisps dwell in deeper water, in caves on the ocean floor or hollows at the bottom of sizeable lakes. They are isolative and territorial. They are also smart enough to realize how dim they are, and this realization makes them irritable and unpredictable. They have a keen sense of smell, and immediately investigate creatures that stray too close to their lair. Their curiosity usually takes the form of pulling apart intruders to see how they are built.</p><p>Though technically sentient, nisps do not reason the way most creatures do. They have no concept of love, duty, or hatred, though they do seem capable of nearly insatiable curiosity and malice.</p><p>This fearsome creature is 9 feet tall, with light gray skin and a white underbelly, and weighs well over 300 pounds. It has large, wicked talons and an unusually large mouth, filled with dagger-like teeth.</p><p>Gray nisps surprise intruders if they can. They may start with their spell-like powers, or engage directly in melee; they may even attempt to speak with intruders, though their innate stupidity usually results in increasing frustration, and finally a burst into action.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d6+56)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 17, Con 24, Int 5, Wis 11, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2664, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "24, touch 12, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Gray Nisp", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +13, Sense Motive +2, Stealth +10, Swim +25", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "water dependent", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +9, Will +6", "Melee": "2 claws +10 (1d6+6), bite +9 (1d8+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., swim 80 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Large"}
