Two great horns protrude upward from its oval head. Huge leathery, bat-like wings sprout from its shoulders, and its lower torso sports two massive legs that end in soot-colored hooves. Short, coarse black hair covers its entire body, except its face and clawed hands.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Maphistal</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 21</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>409,600</h5><h5>CE Large outsider (chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+11; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +42</h5><h5><b>Aura </b><i>unholy aura</i> (DC 26)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>39, touch 24, flat-footed 32 (+7 Dex, +15 natural, -1 size, +8 profane)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>330 (20d10+220)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+25, <b>Ref </b>+13, <b>Will </b>+21</h5><h5><b>DR </b>20/cold iron and good; <b>Immune </b>electricity, poison; <b>Resist </b>acid 10, cold 10, fire 10; <b>SR </b>32</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>40 ft., fly 80 ft.

The <i>crushing</i> special quality crushes the skulls of those it strikes. Upon a successful critical hit, the weapon crushes the opponent's skull (if it has one) instantly killing the target. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no skulls, others, such as golems and incorporeal <i>undead</i>, are not affected by the <i>crushing</i> special quality. Most other creatures, however, die when their skull is crushed.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Maphistal is a lieutenant in the employ of Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead. He makes his home on a stinking, smoldering Abyssal plane where he commands his troops from his great castle, <i>Maalstege</i> (The Keep of Bones-so called because it is believed to be constructed from the skeletal remains of those slain by Maphistal). He is loyal to no one but Orcus. He does not trust Sonechard, the General of Orcus's <i>undead</i> legions, and seeks to discredit him at any opportunity, though he does not do this openly for fear of rebellion by his troops or punishment by Orcus.</p><p>His machinations against Sonechard are primarily through his agents and spies in Sonechard's camps.</p><p>Maphistal stands 9 feet tall and weighs 700 pounds.</p><p>Maphistal is rarely, if ever, encountered alone, and usually has a retinue of <i>undead</i> with him. When he enters combat, he usually opens with his spell-like abilities, immediately using his <i>circle of death</i> ability to affect as many targets as possible. In melee, he batters an opponent with his mace. An opponent whose skull is destroy (and who is therefore slain) or an opponent brought to Dexterity 0 (and not rescued by his comrades) is carried back to the Keep of Bones where it is transformed into an <i>undead</i> creature or becomes part of the Keep itself.</p><p>Credit Maphistal first appeared in the Necromancer Games module <i>R3 Rappan Athuk 3</i>: <i>The Lower Levels</i> (\u00a92002, Necromancer Games, Inc.).</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Ignan, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Maphistal plus 2-16 skeletons and zombies and 1-4 wights or 1-4 spectres and 1-8 wraiths)", "Ref": "13", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(20d10+220)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 36, Dex 25, Con 33, Int 25, Wis 25, Cha 26", "Gear": "Vox", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2463, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Deceitful, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "25", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "39, touch 24, flat-footed 32", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Maphistal", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +35, Diplomacy +31, Disguise +32, Fly +32, Intimidate +31, Knowledge (arcana) +27, Knowledge (nobility) +27, Knowledge (planes) +30, Perception +42, Sense Motive +34, Spellcraft +30, Stealth +26, Use Magical Device +31", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "21", "Race": "", "CR": "21", "XP": 409600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +25, Ref +13, Will +21", "Melee": "+3 unholy crushing heavy mace +35/+30/+25/+20 (2d6+16 plus bone knit) or 2 claws +32 (1d6+13), bite +32 (1d8+13 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 80 ft.
