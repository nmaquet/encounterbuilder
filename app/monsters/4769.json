A creature that starts its turn within the area is subjected to the cobalt viper's poison. The poison from this aura is weaker than its bite however, and deals only 1d2 points of Con damage (instead of 1d6 Con damage).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Cobalt vipers are poisonous snakes found on the Plane of Molten Skies. Whatever magic transported the Steel Garden to that realm is thought to have brought the vipers here as well. They are indigenous to the Garden and are virtually unknown outside of it. A cobalt viper appears to be constructed of metal; in fact its scales are actually a composite of the steel found within the Steel Garden and normal snake scales. How exactly these creatures came to exist is unknown. A typical cobalt viper is about 5 feet long though species up to 12 feet long or more have been sighted. Cobalt vipers are sometimes hunted by intelligent races for their scales. The scales are taken and fashioned into various pieces of jewelry or used to adorn armor and weapons. Cobalt vipers are highly aggressive predators that prefer to attack from ambush. Normally, a cobalt viper trails its prey allowing its poison aura to sap the target's strength. After its prey is sufficiently weakened, the cobalt viper lunges from its hiding place and strikes.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or nest (3-6)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(11d10+44)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 17, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4769, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth), Vital Strike, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics, +4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "22, touch 12, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Giant Cobalt Viper", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +16, Climb +19, Perception +14, Stealth +12, Swim +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Molten Skies)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +10, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +17 (2d6+9 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
