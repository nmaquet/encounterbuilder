This attack deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Flayer devils are employed by several arch-devils as trackers and hunters because of their brutal and sadistic mindset. These nightmarish creatures delight in catching their prey and ripping the flesh from their bones. The flesh is devoured and the bones cast aside. Many of these brutes served under Lucifer and were ousted with him when Asmodeus cast him out of Hell. They now reside in Infernus where they perfect their craft against those that stumble into the fiery realm. Others can still be found roaming the Hells. Flayer devils sometimes hunt weaker devils, such as bearded devils, hellstokers (see their entry in this book), and lemures, the latter of whose flesh they thoroughly enjoy.</p><p>The typical flayer devil stands 13 feet tall and weighs in excess of 800 pounds.</p><p>Flayer devils are ferocious in battle, employing simple, brutal tactics.</p><p>Given the chance, they always make a full attack, striking with both claws and a bite attempting to rip an opponent's flesh from its bones. On rounds they do not attack with their natural weapons, they release an unholy burst to sicken those around them before striking again with claws and bite.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Ignan, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-4) or pack (6-11)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+108)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 29, Dex 15, Con 29, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2472, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Improved Critical (claw), Power Attack, Weapon Focus (bite), Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "27, touch 11, flat-footed 25", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Flayer Devil", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +24, Escape Artist +17, Intimidate +17, Knowledge (planes) +17, Perception +21, Sense Motive +21, Stealth +13, Survival +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Hell)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +10, Will +10", "Melee": "2 claws +21 (1d8+9/19-20), bite +21 (2d6+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Large"}
