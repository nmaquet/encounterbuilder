Upon contact with the air, the oil bursts into flames. The oil normally burns for 1 minute before extinguishing itself. Anyone contacting the burning oil takes 3d6 points of fire damage. Underwater, a fire eel can release this oil quickly (as a swift action) in a 10-foot radius around its body. The oil automatically ignites at the start of the fire eel's next turn. It deals the same fire damage as above, but only burns for 5 rounds underwater. A fire eel can ignite its oil once per minute in this way.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Fire eels are a beautiful but dangerous species of aquatic beast that secrete and can ignite an oily residue on their skin to drive away predators and attract a mate. The flames emitted by a fire eel can be green, blue, red, or violet, or even a pattern of these colors, depending on the individual eel. Fire eels can be particularly dangerous to seagoing vessels during their mating season, when they come to the surface en masse to perform fiery courtship rituals, and are more aggressive than usual. Fire eels are at home in both saltwater and freshwater, and live in groups of up to 10 eels. A fire eel lair consists of a number of long and winding tunnels burrowed into sand, rocks, or mud in shallow water. These tunnels eventually empty into a large central chamber. Fire eels, normally non-aggressive, become highly aggressive if their lair is threatened. Fire eels are normally inoffensive, and avoid combat if possible. However, if they are attacked, grabbed, or if it is their mating season, they become more aggressive, and use their fire shroud to ward off attacks while they bite relentlessly until their opponents are driven away.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or nest (3-10)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+18)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4814, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Escape Artist", "AC": "19, touch 11, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Fire Eel", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Escape Artist +10, Perception +7, Stealth +3, Swim +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm oceans", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +9, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +12 (2d6+9 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
