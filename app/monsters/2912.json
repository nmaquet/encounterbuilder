Its sole purpose seems to be the collection and destruction of the souls of the living. Some tales spoken only in whispers say the entropic ooze is the creation of an insane god, sent to destroy life so that the gods may remake creation. Others conjecture that the entropic ooze is the creation of some vile and evil spellcaster warped on the perverseness of its own destruction and that of the world around it. Whatever its true purpose, the entropic ooze is a deadly creature that seems to have no useful purpose in the ecosystem, save perhaps to those of a destructive nature.</p><p>Entropic oozes can be found just about anywhere, though most are found in or near locations frequented by living creatures. They prefer areas of darkness, such as subterranean caves, dungeons, and the like, where their naturally dark coloration allows them to blend into the natural darkness.</p><p>An entropic ooze is an amorphous and swirling mass of black protoplasm that covers an area of 10 feet or more. Its form resembles that of a black pudding and it is often mistaken for said creature. The entropic ooze is naturally cold to the touch and those that have contacted the ooze (and lived), speak of the unnatural energy they felt flowing through it.</p><p>The screams of those that have been absorbed are thought to be heard emanating from the creature's form as it undulates along.</p><p>A entropic ooze is driven by its hunger and need to absorb souls. It attacks by forming pseudopods from its protoplasmic form or by simply rolling over its opponents and absorbing them into its form. After devouring the soul of an engulfed creature, the entropic ooze ejects the creature's physical body, now a dried and crumbling husk. An entropic ooze prefers to absorb as many creatures as it can into its body, and then pummel those that avoid being engulfed with its powerful pseudopods.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(11d8+88)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 6, Con 26, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2912, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "12, touch 7, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Entropic Ooze", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-2", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Negative Energy Plane", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +1, Will -2", "Melee": "slam +13 (2d6+9 plus energy drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.
