A creature bitten by a gibrileth or damaged by a weapon it wields is exposed to this virulent disease. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save is needed to resist this creature's particular strain of demonplague-full details on this widespread sickness appear on page 29. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Tumors (Su)</b> As a swift action, a gibrileth can rip a grapefruit-sized tumor from its body with one of its many arms and throw it as a splash weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage, and deals 1d4 points of acid splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target. A creature can avoid the splash damage with a successful DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Whip Specialist (Ex)</b> A gibrileth does not provoke attacks of opportunity when using a whip.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Gibrileths are known as filth demons because their appearance is so vile that even other demons find them appalling-including some hezrous. A gibrileth's body is composed almost entirely of quivering, globular, acidic tumors, save for its batlike wings and the nest of spindly, atrophied arms growing from the top of its body. It can walk with a clumsy gait, using its long arms, but it prefers to be on the wing. These creatures enjoy spreading nausea and sickness, either via their spell-like abilities or through violence-in fact, they are one of the primary sources of demonplague throughout the Worldwound. Gibrileths particularly relish the taste of partially liquefied, diseased flesh, and many keep infected victims in pens like cattle for periodic snacking, allowing their sickness to season them properly before feeding. Gibrileths rise from the souls of mortals who deliberately encourage the spread of disease or sickness, many of whom died of disease themselves. A gibrileth is approximately 10 feet in diameter, with a wingspan of 16 feet. These foul, bloated demons typically weigh about 2,400 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "The Worldwound", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or infection (3-8)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d10+77)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 19, Con 24, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "tumor +14 (2d6 acid plus disease)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.
