Ugash-Iram and its lesser kin practice foul rites and perform horrible rituals to honor their patron deity, Dagon, amid the city's strange and twisted spires, which rise out of a dark fissure in the seabed like claws climbing toward the surface. Crackling eruptions of magical energy brief ly illuminate the city in flashes of light, but it is otherwise as dark and lightless as the souls of its foul inhabitants. Because of its isolation in the deepest waters of the Obari Ocean, few surface-dwellers know of Ugash- Iram's existence, though those fisherfolk and sailors who've heard tales of the mighty being know to fear it. Locathah sages place the indomitable gutaki's age at over 3,000 years old, and dwellers in the underwater regions surrounding Achom have long loathed and feared Ugash-Iram, whose legions of devotees have spelled the ruin of countless aquatic cities. Ugash-Iram itself is responsible for destroying a dozen massive underwater cities in the past millennium, and the scattered ruins that lie around the Yogisa Trench serve as testament to its power. Those aquatic creatures Ugash-Iram doesn't outright annihilate are captured and integrated into Achom either as members of the slave caste or as converted devotees to Dagon. Entire tribes of sahuagin, adaros, and iku-tursos have united under the banner of Ugash-Iram and its gutaki kin in Achom, and the underwater metropolis bulges at the borders with the thousands of evil inhabitants who make their home there. These inhabitants raid for Ugash-Iram and populate its city, protecting Achom and performing all kinds of menial tasks for their overlord. With these minions, Ugash-Iram's deadly reach extends all the way to the surface of the Obari Ocean and even the nearby shores of Geb, Jalmeray, and Qadira. Isolated in its flooded metropolis beneath the sea, Ugash-Iram has plenty of resources, a generous life span, and thousands of minions at its disposal, making it a formidable foe for any who would seek to stop the despotic gutaki before its inf luence spreads even further. <br><b>Infamous Deeds</b><br> The legends of Ugash-Iram remain shrouded in mystery, since few aquatic humanoids have seen the monster, and fewer still have lived to tell the tale. Some claim that the gutaki gained its power by devouring other gutaki, gaining greater power and its array of 12 tentacles. One especially strange tale claims Ugash-Iram once captured a great kraken and imprisoned it deep in the gaping Yogisa Trench. Ugash-Iram is said to keep the behemoth perpetually on the brink of death-the gutaki and its minions carefully torture the kraken and subject it to grotesque experiments and disfiguring transformations. Just as gutaki were supposedly born when Dagon defeated the great kraken Kaktora, Ugash-Iram hopes that by subjecting its captured kraken to cruel experiments, it can create its own race of 12-tentacled followers. While ships crossing the middle of the Obari Ocean face all manner of risks, perhaps the worst is capture by Ugash-Iram's minions. Records tell of a combined effort by Ugash-Iram's adaro and sahuagin soldiers to capture a diplomatic fleet from Vudra some years ago. A dozen lucky sailors perished during the raid; the aquatic horrors captured everyone else, smearing them with a magical jelly that allowed them to breathe underwater and dragging them to Achom for torture, experimentation, and eventual sacrifice to their lord Dagon. <br><b>Adventure Hooks</b><br> Tracking Ugash-Iram down is not a task for the faint of heart, and those who do manage to find the vile underwater metropolis of Achom would do well to stay away. Despite the danger, adventurers might find any number of reasons to explore the foul settlement and face its cruel inhabitants. <ul><li> A tribe of adaro aligned with Ugash-Iram of Achom threatens Vudrani vessels bound for Jalmeray. At risk of losing their precious cargo, merchants send word to ports along the Obari Ocean's shores, searching for a group to deal with the adaro threat and determine their true motives. <li> Tired of living in fear of Ugash-Iram, locathah, merfolk, cecaelias, and other non-evil aquatic creatures recently formed a congress to address the gutaki's tyranny. Legends tell of a magical device of unknown origin lost within the Obari Ocean south of Stonespire Island. Thought to be capable of blocking out mental domination-among other powers-this device would prove a great weapon in the fight against Ugash-Iram and the other denizens of Achom. The aquatic council has put out a great bounty for retrieval of the item.</ul></p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Aquan, Common; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "AP 60", "Land": "1", "Organization": "?", "Ref": "14", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(17d10+136)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 32, Dex 19, Con 26, Int 13, Wis 20, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "30 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3324, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Deadly Finish**, Greater Disarm, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Stand Still", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "18", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "28, touch 6, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Ugash-iram", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +13, Knowledge (geography) +10, Knowledge (planes) +11, Perception +20, Sense Motive +13, Stealth -8, Swim +23", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "?", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +18, Ref +14, Will +10", "Melee": "tentacles +20 (6d6+11 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Colossal"}
