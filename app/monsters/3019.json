The sleeping willow heals 5 points of damage whenever it drains Constitution, gaining temporary hit points (if bonus hit points exceed the sleeping willows total). At Constitution 0, the creature dies and its body is absorbed by the sleeping willow's roots. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Sleep Spores (Ex)</b> As a standard action, a sleeping willow can eject a cloud of yellowish pollen from its body in a 30-foot spread. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 19 Will save or fall asleep for 10 minutes. There is no HD limit for this sleep effect. The save DC is </h5><h5><b>Constitution</b>-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Sleeping willows are slow-moving, carnivorous plant creatures with evil dispositions. Most sleeping willows make their home among groves or areas of normal willow trees where they can use their natural appearance to their advantage. Though capable of movement, the sleeping willow only moves at night, so as not to be detected or seen. Once a hunting area becomes depopulated or scarce, the sleeping willow moves on to better hunting grounds where it takes root and repeats the above cycle of waiting, hunting, and moving on to a new location. Sleeping willows do not collect treasure but the treasure from their past victims is often scattered about the base of the tree. Sleeping willows do not mind this, for they know that greedy treasure-seekers will be lured in by this and it makes catching a meal that much easier.</p><p>A sleeping willow appears as a normal willow tree (and is often mistaken for such) standing 15 or more feet tall. Some species have been rumored to reach heights in excess of 30 feet. Its trunk is 2 feet or more in diameter and dark brown in color. From the trunk sprout branches that end in long drooping and graceful twigs. The sleeping willow is crowned with leaves of green or brownish-green.</p><p>A sleeping willow prefers to attack from ambush when potential prey wanders too close to it. Once prey is in range, the sleeping willow releases its spores and then attacks with its branches, grabbing its prey in its viselike grip. Grappled creatures are drained of their body fluids and absorbed by the tree.</p><p>A grove of sleeping willows act in concert against multiple opponents, aiding one another when necessary until the opponents are slain or flee.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or grove (2-5)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d8+44 plus 11)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 8, Con 19, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3019, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Improved Critical (slam), Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness, Weapon Focus (slam),", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+10 Stealth in forests", "AC": "23, touch 7, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sleeping Willow", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +11, Stealth +0 (+10 in forests)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +2, Will +4", "Melee": "4 slams +15 (2d6+8 19-12/x2 plus grab plus Constitution drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Huge"}
