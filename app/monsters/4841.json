If rocks are available (as when the ulkreth uses its ground pounder ability to create rubble) it can pick up a single rock as a swift action, two rocks as a move action, or four rocks as a full-round action. If an ulkreth has a rock in each hand, it cannot use its rock catching ability. </h5><h5><b>Ground Pounder (Ex)</b> As a standard action, an ulkreth can strike the ground with its powerful fists, turning the area within a 10-foot radius into dense rubble (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 412). Any creatures in this area at the time must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or fall prone. An ulkreth's movement is not slowed by the rubble it creates. </h5><h5><b>Punch Through (Ex)</b> An ulkreth can use a full-attack action to make its gore and slam attacks against the same opponent. The ulkreth then totals the damage from all hits before applying any damage reduction or hardness. </h5><h5><b>Wrecker (Su)</b> An ulkreth's rend special attack deals double damage to objects.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Ulkreths are among the mightiest servants of the demon lord Xoveron, the Horned Prince of gargoyles and lord of ruination. They exist solely to destroy, carrying out his will of devastation to cities and civilization throughout the planes, tearing down monuments and buildings in the name of their unholy patron. Ulkreths are 25 feet tall and weigh 10 tons. <b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> Ulkreth demons form from the souls of mortals who spread wanton destruction and vandalism, burning and tearing down what others have labored long to build up. Small-scale vandals do not earn damnation for simple graffiti and petty breakage; ulkreths arise from those who devoted their lives to bringing ruin forge their own chain of condemnation with every new act of malicious deconstruction. Some do so by targeting grand works of art, stately monuments, cathedrals, libraries, and historical edifices, destroying not just physical structures but also the artistic and cultural legacy of their own people, or of other cultures living among them. These targets are singled out for defacement as a sign of the vandal's hate. The pinnacle of vandalism, however, is attained by those who not only cause damage to property but also murder via their sabotage-collapsing mines and trapping miners to die choking in the dark; breaching dams and dikes to unleash deadly floodwaters that wreak devastation; or bombing, burning, or otherwise destroying homes, businesses, and other gathering places. Whether done as an anarchic political statement, for revenge upon those who owned the buildings, or for pure psychotic joy at watching the world crumble, these are the blackest-hearted vandals of all. The level of destruction perpetrated by mortals in life is important to their lord Xoveron because while his will is bent on the ruination of every civilization, tearing down the literal and figurative structures that hold society together, he is still only a minor demon lord. His power is insufficient to endow every servant with great abilities. Lesser vandals simply do not rate a major investment of his lordly power, and if made into demons at all, may be consigned to eternity as mere dretches, or as fiendish gargoyles rather than actual demons. It is only those whose acts of destruction are truly heinous that inspire him to transform them into ulkreths. Ulkreth demons are unusual, however, in that they can also be formed not from one soul but from many, especially in the case of gangs that once worked together as mortals in their acts of destruction. These joint-souled ulkreths are, if anything, even more savage and destructive than their fellows, as the different soul fragments bound together struggle for mastery, trying to show their dominance by wreaking greater mayhem than their rivals. Ulkreths do not need to eat or drink, but they enjoy chewing and swallowing powdered stone and <i>shatter</i>ed glass, twisted metal and splintered wood. They consume the detritus of their destruction as a ritual of satisfaction after their rampages. Some say they gain sustenance from these <i>shatter</i>ed remains and claim that if ulkreths are prevented from destroying for too long, they can actually waste away and die of starvation, though planar scholars know that outsiders don't need to eat to live. Ulkreths cannot reproduce biologically and are propagated only by the transformation of new souls into ulkreths. <b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> Most ulkreths inhabit the endless ruins of Ghahazi, the hearth of their master Xoveron. There they tend groves of fiendish treants that wait amidst the ruins, crumbling foundation stones with their defiled roots even as they stand ready to batter and smash at the ulkreths' command. Flights of fiendish gargoyles wheel constantly overhead, making aeries of the <i>shatter</i>ed spires of the Horned Prince's city and flocking ahead of the ulkreths when they march. Xoveron often barters the service of his ulkreths with other demon lords or their generals, especially in siege situations where demonic teleportation is of no avail and defenses must be breached with naked strength. Ulkreths may be kept back as artillery, but they chafe under efforts to suppress their urges to sunder and smash and have often been known to abandon their orders and wade directly into a fray or smash down gates and walls with their bare fists. On the Material Plane, the cultists of Xoveron and his gargoyle minions stand sentinel against the encroachment of civilization, ready to foil its ambitious reach towards eternity. When his minions report cities growing too great, too lovely, or too proud, Xoveron tempts mortals with a gluttonous hunger for power and a jealous pride and rage toward their fellows that drives them to call forth a ulkreth demon. Mortal gargoyles can sense the presence of one of their master's favored servants and flock to its side to swoop hooting and screeching overhead as the wrecker commences a reign of terror. Of course, ulkreths are notoriously indiscriminate about their destruction, and those summoning them must be very careful not to become casualties of the ulkreth's rampage.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic", "Source": "AP 73", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or crew (2-4 ulkreths)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(17d10+136)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 30, Dex 11, Con 26, Int 7, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "4 rocks +14 (3d6+10)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "20 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4841, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Charge ThroughAPG, Greater Overrun, Greater Sunder, Improved Critical (slams), Improved Overrun, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Sundering StrikeAPG , Weapon Focus (slams)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "18", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "30, touch 6, flat-footed 30", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ulkreth", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +28, Intimidate +22, Knowledge (engineering) +18, Perception +30, Swim +23", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "12", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +18, Ref +5, Will +12", "Melee": "gore +23 (2d8+10 plus 1d6 piercing), 4 slams +24 (2d6+10/19-20 plus 1d6 piercing)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 20 ft., fly 50 ft.
