The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature that fails its save is partially blinded and overcome with fits of sneezing. Both effects last 1d6+2 rounds. An affected creature takes a -1 penalty to AC, loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks and on Strength- and Dexterity-based skills and checks. All checks relying on vision (such as reading and Perception) have a 50% chance of failing. All opponents are considered to have concealment (20% miss chance) relative to the blinded character. </h5><h5><b>Tentacle-Barbs (Ex)</b> A belabra's tentacles are lined with razor-sharp barbs. Anytime a grappled creature attempts to break free, it takes 1d4+1 points of piercing damage from the barbs.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Belabras are large, jellyfish-like omnivores that dwell in deep forests and thick undergrowth. They sustain themselves on a diet of plants, berries, and rodents. Particularly hungry belabras will attack larger creatures (such as humanoids).</p><p>Belabras (called \"tanglers\" by some) resemble jellyfish about 5 feet in diameter. Its eyes have no pupils. A small, bird-like beak is hidden among its array of tentacles.</p><p>A belabra attacks by slamming into its opponents with its hard, chitinous shell or by lashing out with its tentacles. Grabbed opponents are pulled in and bitten.</p><p>Credit The Belabra originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Creature Catalog</i> (<i>Dragon</i> #94) (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1985) and later in the Second Edition <i>Monstrous Compendium</i> (MC 3) (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1991) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Ed Greenwood.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+8 plus 4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2262, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Multiattack, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception", "AC": "15, touch 12, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Belabra", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly -2, Perception +10, Stealth +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +5", "Melee": "slam +6 (2d4+2), tentacles +4 (grab) or bite +6 (2d4+3), tentacles +4 (grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., fly 20 ft.
