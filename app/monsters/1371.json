This attack has a range of 200 feet with no range increment, and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. A creature critically hit by a thunderbolt is stunned and deafened for 1 round if it fails a DC 22 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Storm Aura (Su)</b> A thunderbird is surrounded by a 100-footradius spread of severe winds that blow out from the center, dissipating swiftly at the limit of the aura's range. In this area, ranged weapons (but not siege weapons) take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, Fly checks are made at a -4 penalty, and exposed flames are extinguished. Small creatures must make a DC 10 Strength check (if on the ground) or a DC 20 Fly check to move toward the thunderbird, while Tiny or smaller creatures can be knocked backward (1d4 x 10 feet if they are on the ground and fail a DC 15 Strength check, or 2d6 x 10 feet if they are flying and fail a DC 25 Fly check). Creatures on the ground that are pushed back take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet, and flying creatures that are pushed back take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage regardless of the distance they are pushed. In addition, once every 1d4 rounds, a bolt of lightning strikes a random creature (other than the thunderbird) within the area of its storm aura. This bolt of lightning deals 12d6 points of electricity damage (DC 22 Reflex halves). The save DC for the lightning bolt is Constitutionbased, while those for resisting the wind effects are fixed. </h5><h5><b>Stormsight (Ex)</b> A thunderbird ignores all vision penalties and concealment from weather effects, including those created by <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>obscuring mist</i>, and similar spells.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Thunderbirds bring the storm on their wings. In times of drought, they are welcomed with joy and celebration.</p><p>In other times, they are placated with gifts in hopes that they might leave quickly before flooding begins. When angered, thunderbirds can call down hurricanes and lay waste to entire villages, so in regions where these birds dwell, many villages maintain extensive rituals designed to appease and honor the local thunderbirds.</p><p>Thunderbirds nest near the base of waterfalls, where the constant thrum of crashing water prepares the hatchlings for a life at the heart of a storm. Once the chicks have hatched, their parents carry the offspring to nests at the top of mountains, where the young are struck by their first bolts of lightning and learn the mysteries of the storm.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(14d10+70)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 17, Con 21, Int 12, Wis 16, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "thunderbolt +13 ranged touch (6d6 electricity and 6d6 sonic)", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "20 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1371, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Critical Focus, Dodge, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Critical (claw), Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "25, touch 10, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Thunderbird", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +13, Fly +11, Perception +20, Perform (sing) +8, Sense Motive +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any hills or mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +12, Will +9", "Melee": "2 claws +18 (2d6+8/19-20 plus grab), bite +18 (2d8+8/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 120 ft.
