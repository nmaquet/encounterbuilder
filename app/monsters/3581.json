The creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have its memories affected in a manner similar to the spell <i>modify memory</i>. The viduus can rewrite 1 day's worth of the target's memories with a single strike. As a result, the creature is either stunned or confused for the next 1d4 rounds (50% chance of either). At the GM's discretion, this might have longer-term effects. A creature's memories can be restored by <i>lesser restoration</i>, <i>modify memory</i>, or similar spells. Memories lost in this manner are copied into one of the numerous tomes protected by the viduus. This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Expurgate (Su)</b> A viduus that strikes a dead creature-such as a soul, petitioner, or undead creature-with its quill can obliterate that creature's memories. The creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have all of its memories erased. It retains language and basic knowledge, but no details as to the events of its life. This typically leaves the creature calm and indifferent to all beings around it. This memory loss is permanent, though the memories can be restored by <i>lesser restoration</i>, <i>modify memory</i>, or similar spells. Memories lost in this manner are copied into one of the numerous tomes protected by the viduus. This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Transformation (Su)</b> A viduus that is reduced to 0 hit points transforms. Its cocoon body bursts open, expelling a swarm of biting white-and-black centipedes (same statistics as a spider swarm) and a bank of <i>mind fog</i> centered on the viduus's square. A viduus can purposefully transform by spending three consecutive full-round actions, in which case it reforms somewhere in the Boneyard 1 month later.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Viduuses occupy the libraries and scriptoriums located atop Pharasma's spire. While lesser psychopomps record every soul's death and ultimate fate upon the planes, viduuses are interested in more extraordinary souls-their lives, deeds, deaths, and secrets. Existence holds many mysteries, and those mortals who had brushes with the extraordinary have their tales and confessions recorded by these semi-cocooned scholars and added to the volumes of the Boneyard's expansive library, known as the Catalogue of Last Days. Although pretentious in the extreme, viduuses prove quite knowledgeable about many historical and planar secrets, and what they don't know they generally have a decent idea of how to research, potentially summoning assistants from across the planes to aid them.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Infernal", "Source": "Inner Sea Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or library (3-12)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(5d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 11, Con 18, Int 15, Wis 19, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3581, "SubType": "(extraplanar, psychopomp)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Improved Initiative, Iron Will", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 10, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Viduus", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +11, Climb +8, Diplomacy +11, Knowledge (history) +10, Knowledge (planes) +10, Knowledge (religion) +10, Perception +14, Sense Motive +14, Stealth +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (the Boneyard)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "spirit touch, transformation", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +10", "Melee": "quill +5 (1d4 plus censor or expurgate)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
