Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane. Some lore even casts the janni as the most \"human\" of the genie races, although most jann are quick to correct this insult, usually with the edge of a sword. A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds. Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite prone to seeing insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle, they escape using flight and <i>invisibility</i>, returning later with reinforcements. Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the deep desert and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need of food, water, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of a favor at some later date. Among the other genie races, jann generally have good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their armies. A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble jann, often called sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-<i>augury</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, and <i>divination. A</i> noble janni's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 12th. Noble jann are CR 7.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, one elemental language (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran), one planar language (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal); telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, company (3-6), or band (7-12)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "composite longbow +8/+3 (1d8+3/x3)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 200, "SubType": "(native)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved InitiativeB, Mobility", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 13, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Janni", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Appraise +11, Craft (any one-usually weaponsmith) +11, Fly +14, Perception +11, Ride +6, Sense Motive +11, Spellcraft +11, Stealth +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm deserts", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "elemental endurance", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +7, Will +4", "Melee": "scimitar +9/+4 (1d6+4/18-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 20 ft.
