Trees used by the decapus in this manner can be no further than 10 feet apart. </h5><h5><b>Sound Imitation (Ex)</b> A decapus can mimic any creature it has previously encountered with near total accuracy, though it cannot mimic humanoid speech longer than two or three words at a time. A DC 13 Will save detects the ruse. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Decapi are solitary creatures that dwell in dense forests or underground.</p><p>Most prefer the forests as their ability to move among the trees allows them to either pursue their prey or flee in situations not to their advantage.</p><p>On the ground, decapi are slow-moving, thus they spend most of their time among the tree tops.</p><p>Decapi are nocturnal hunters and are quite fond of human, elf, and halfling flesh. In times when food is scarce, they exist on a diet of rats, snakes, and other small forest creatures (or dungeon denizens in the case of the subterranean decapus).</p><p>Decapi prefer a solitary life; the only time more than one will ever be encountered together is during mating season (usually the fall). Young decapi are born live, and the female only ever gives birth to a single young during each mating season. If food is extremely scarce, some decapus females have been known to eat their young.</p><p>This creature's body is a 4-foot diameter globe of pallid green. On rare occasions, a purple or even yellow hued decapus may be encountered.</p><p>Patches of dark hair, brown or black, grow in various locations. Regardless of its body color, each decapus has 10 octopus-like tentacles protruding from its spherical body. Each tentacle is covered in suction cups that aid the creature in not only climbing and moving through trees, but also in holding on to its prey. Its large wide maw sports sickly yellow teeth and foul breath.</p><p>Decapi seem to be able to speak with others of their kind using a series of guttural noises.</p><p>Credit The Decapus originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>B3 Palace of the Silver Princess</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Jean Wells.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Decapus", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary (or rarely, a mated pair)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.
