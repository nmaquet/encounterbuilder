The cloud provides total concealment, which the giant water beetle normally uses to escape. All vision within the cloud is obscured. </h5><h5><b>Water Dependent (Ex)</b> Giant water beetles can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, they begin to suffocate. </h5><h5><b>Water sense (Ex)</b> A giant water beetle's watersense ability functions exactly like blindsense, except it only functions underwater.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>These highly aggressive beetles make their home in deep fresh water, such as rivers, lakes, pools, and seas and can be found in any climate, stretching from the warmest to the coldest. Giant water beetles are predators and sustain themselves on fish and other aquatic animals.</p><p>They spend most of their lives in the water, rarely coming on land. If encountered on land, a giant water beetle will never be more than 30 feet from any source of water. They are diurnal creatures and hunt during the day, diving with blinding speed when they spot a potential meal in the water. When not actively hunting, they simply drift along with the current.</p><p>Giant water beetles lair on the bottoms of lakes, pools, and seas. If a colony is found, there will be at least 1 female giant water beetle and 2d4 eggs. Giant water beetle eggs are brownish with flecks of green. Eggs hatch within three weeks after the female deposits them Giant water beetles reach full maturity in six to eight weeks.</p><p>When hunting, these creatures prefer to attack by ambushing their prey from above. They drift along and then dive at the target with blinding speed (treat this as a charge). Prey is bitten by the giant water beetle's oversized mandibles.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "cluster (2-5) or colony (6-11)", "Ref": "0", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 13, Con 16, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2260, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception and Stealth underwater", "AC": "16, touch 16, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Giant Water Beetle", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +0 (+4 underwater) Stealth +1 (+5 underwater) Swim +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any freshwater aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +0, Will +0", "Melee": "bite +5 (1d8+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
