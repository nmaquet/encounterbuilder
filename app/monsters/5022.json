Hunting bands consist of both male and female ommoth with the strongest male being the leader of the pack. Favored prey of an ommoth includes large game, humanoids, and the occasional giant scorpion. Prey is always killed and carried back to the lair to be devoured or fed to the young. Young ommoth remain in the lair for three to six months generally, before dispersing into the world. A typical ommoth can live up to 30 years. An ommoth lair is an underground burrow, either of their devising or an existing and abandoned burrow created by some other burrowing creatures. An existing burrow is often reconfigured to consist of a single long passageway that empties into a large main chamber. Here in the main chamber is the ommoth's nest. Any other passageways and chambers are sealed off by the ommoth with dirt, rocks, debris, and anything else it can find. An ommoth is highly aggressive and attacks any creature that wanders into its territory. If cornered or threatened, it responds by rearing its claws and poising its tail overhead. Creatures that continue to harass the ommoth are met with a series of tail stings and claw attacks. An ommoth flees if confronted by a superior opponent, but if the nest is threatened, it fights to the death. An ommoth appears as a twelve foot long giant scorpion with four large claws, two long tails that each end in a wicked stinger, and a carapace of reddish-brown or black. It has one set of eyes on the front of its head and two other pairs just behind those on the sides of its head. The creature has two sets of serrated mandibles that help in rending its food. Its forelegs are slightly longer and thinner than its others legs and it uses these to detect prey and explore its surroundings. Some species have white or tan markings on their undersides or white bands on their forelegs.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, hunting band (3-6)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+21)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5022, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "18, touch 9, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ommoth", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +11, Perception +14, Stealth +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm or temperate deserts, forests, plains, or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +5, Will +2", "Melee": "4 claws +13 (1d6+6 plus grab), 2 stings +13 (1d6+6 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
