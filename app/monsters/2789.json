Any melee hit deals 2d6 points of fire damage initially and 1d6 points of damage for the next 1d3 rounds. Creatures attacking a magmoid unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage each time one of their attacks hits just as if the magmoid had hit with a melee attack. </h5><h5><b>Magma Blast (Ex)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a magmoid can release a line of magma to a range of 40 feet. This deals 2d6 points of damage in the round it hits a foe (DC 17 Reflex save for half), and 1d6 points of damage for another 1d3 rounds (no save). </h5><h5><b>Melt Weapons (Ex)</b> Any metal weapon that strikes a magmoid must make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Magmoids are giant balls of elemental magma that destroy or burn anything and everything they come in contact with. Though they are typically only found on the Planes of Earth or Fire or the Plane of Molten Skies (see the City of Brass </b>by Necromancer Games for details on this demiplane), occasionally one slips through a portal or nexus into the Material Plane (usually in the heart of a volcano) where it wreaks havoc upon all things that cross its path; be it creatures, structures, or anything else not immune to fire. Attempts by arcane spellcasters (foolish arcane spellcasters some would say) to control or harness the power of a magmoid, thus far have failed.</p><p>Magmoids seem to serve no purpose in the Ecology of their native plane and are thought to be a living extension of the plane itself. Small bubbling pockets on the magmoid's form serve as sensory organs. A giant magmoid, measuring 30 feet across is thought to exist near the Sea of Fire, though none have ever seen it.</p><p>A magmoid attacks by spraying a blast of superheated magma at opponents or by slamming into and rolling over them. It often targets weapon-wielding creatures first and moves close enough where they can hit with their weapons. The magmoid knows that more than likely should a weapon hit its fiery form, it will be turned into a pile of slag in short order.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Ignan, Terran (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2789, "SubType": "(earth, extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "22, touch 13, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Magmoid", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Elemental Plane of Fire", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +10, Will +5", "Melee": "slam +11 (2d6+2 plus 2d6 fire)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
