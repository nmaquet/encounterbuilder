There is no limit to the number of Hit Dice a sandman can affect with this aura. The save DC is Charisma-based. Creatures attacking a sandman unarmed or with natural attacks are also subject to this special attack. </h5><h5><b>Sleep Aura (Su)</b> A sandman can radiate a 20-foot-radius <i>sleep</i> aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>sleep</i> spell (caster level 8th). There is no limit to the number of Hit Dice a sandman can affect with this aura. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same sandman's <i>sleep</i> aura for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b><i>Protection from Arrows</i> (Su)</b> A sandman is protected by a permanent <i>protection from arrows</i> effect (as the spell) that grants it damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons. This ability is inherent and cannot be dispelled.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Sandmen are silicate creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth.</p><p>Their purpose on the Material Plane is unknown, but spellcasters often summon them when they want to protect someone or something. Though sandmen have evil tendencies many willingly serve summoners of other alignments. Sandmen have an immense dislike for humans (reasons unknown) and attack them on sight-human spellcasters take heed when employing their services! A sandman attacks its opponent by pummeling it with its fists, though it prefers to avoid combat if possible. Given the chance, a sandman attempts to put an opponent to <i>sleep</i> rather than kill it. A <i>sleep</i>ing creature is left to its own devices; a sandman does not further attack a creature it puts to <i>sleep</i>. Sleeping creatures are often carried to the sandman's master where they are enslaved or worse.</p><p>Credit The Sandman originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Roger Musson.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Terran", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 12, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2983, "SubType": "(elemental, extraplanar, earth)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 11, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sandman", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Knowledge (arcana) +7, Knowledge (planes) +7, Perception +7, Sense Motive +7, Stealth +8, Use Magic Device +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Elemental Plane of Earth", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +2, Will +4", "Melee": "slam +7 (1d4+3 plus sleep)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
