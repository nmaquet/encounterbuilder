While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep. An elder thing can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes- while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a hibernating elder thing. If it is jostled or damaged while hibernating, an elder thing can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 1d4 days to awaken from hibernation. An elder thing can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, an elder thing needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary. </h5><h5><b>Limited Starflight (Ex)</b> An elder thing can survive in the void of outer space, and its wings allow it to use its fly speed in that environment despite the lack of air. Unlike creatures with full starflight, an elder thing's ability to fly in outer space does not allow it to reach unusually high speeds-an elder thing that wishes to travel from one planet to another typically calculates the distance and then hibernates for the majority of the journey, relying on its momentum and inertia to carry it to its destination while it slumbers along the way.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Known by various names on various worlds, but most often as \"elder things\" or \"old ones,\" these alien creatures are interested in creating lasting works of art, architecture, and even life (such as the dreaded shoggoths). They possess a boundless capacity for war and egotism. A typical elder thing is 6 feet tall from head to foot, with a 7-foot wingspan. Surprisingly heavy for its size, an elder thing generally weighs about 450 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Elder Thing", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, pod (3-8), or expedition (9-16)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+28)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 14, Con 19, Int 20, Wis 16, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5204, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Endurance, Great Fortitude", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 12, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Elder Thing", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Disable Device +9, Fly +4, Heal +10, Knowledge (arcana) +12, Perception +13, Spellcraft +15, Survival +13, Swim +20, Use Magic Device +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious, hibernation, limited starflight, no breath", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +4, Will +8", "Melee": "5 tentacles +7 (1d4+2 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 20 ft.
