The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Chant (Su)</b> By chanting for one full round, a firebird can create any one of the following effects: <i>cure serious wounds</i>, <i>remove blindness/deafness</i>, <i>remove disease</i>, <i>remove fear</i>, or <i>slow poison</i>. Each is usable once per round at will, but a single creature can only gain the benefit of each one once per day. Each functions as the spell of the same name with a caster level equal to the firebird's Hit Dice.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Firebirds are considered by many to be good luck. Sighting one on a journey is considered to be a boon (unless of course you are evil, in which case it is deemed bad luck to see a firebird). Firebirds are thought of as protectors and guardians of the forest and often befriend elves, creatures. They dislike orcs, goblins, and any who would despoil and destroy the forests. These creatures roost in great caves far away from civilized lands and are usually only seen in the early morning or evening hours. Once a month firebirds take to the night sky at the stroke of midnight. To the casual observer a firebird in the night sky appears to be a shooting star or comet flying across the sky. Firebirds claim vast amounts of territory as their own, protecting this domain from evil, and also using it as their own personal hunting ground. Such domains often overlap with other firebirds (which suits each just fine as they share the duties of guardianship over the overlapping territory). Firebirds live on a diet of game animals, fruits, nuts, and berries. A firebird appears as a large bird about 8 feet long with golden and silver feathers. A majestic crest of gold runs from its head, along its back, and disappears into its tail feathers. Its beak and claws are the color of pearls and its eyes shine like crystal. Firebirds almost always attack evil-aligned creatures and those that would despoil their forests. They prefer to fight from the air and always enter battle with their <i>magic circle against evil</i> in effect. A firebird usually begins combat using its blinding brilliance, followed quickly by its breath weapon. Foes that continue to press the fight are held (if evil) or subjected to a <i>sunburst</i>.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran, Celestial, Common, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+36)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 15, Con 19, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4943, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Multiattack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "20, touch 11, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Firebird", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Diplomacy +11, Fly +8, Heal +11, Knowledge (any one) +11, Perception +15, Sense Motive +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "chant", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +8, Will +7", "Melee": "2 claws +13 (1d8+5), bite +13 (2d6+5), 2 wings +11 (1d6+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 70 ft.
