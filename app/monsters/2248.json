During this time, a basidirond cannot use its spores or hallucination cloud special attacks. </h5><h5><b>Hallucination Cloud (Ex)</b>: As a standard action, a basidirond can release a cloud of invisible spores in a 20-foot radius centered on its form. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be confused for as long as they remain in the cloud plus 1d4 rounds after leaving the area. A new save must be made each round a creature remains within the affected area. The save DC is Constitution-based. (For more specific hallucinations see the sidebar text.) </h5><h5><b>Spores (Ex)</b> A basidirond's slam attack transfers poisonous spores to its opponent. A creature struck must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or these spores take root in his flesh and deal the listed amount of Constitution damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. A <i>remove disease</i> spell cast on an affected character halts the Constitution damage. <i>Basidirond Spores</i>: Disease-contact; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds; effect 1d4 Con damage; <i>secondary effect</i> 1 Con damage; cure 1 save.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The basidirond is believed to be related to the ascomoid (see that entry), and like its distant relative, makes its lair in underground natural caverns.</p><p>Unlike the ascomoid's lair that is usually damp or wet, the basidirond's lair is unusually dry.</p><p>A basidirond stands about 7 feet tall.</p><p>The basidirond attacks by striking with its cone-shaped cap or by firing a line of spores at an opponent.</p><p>Basidirond Hallucination Cloud Rather than confusing an opponent, you can randomly determine hallucinations for each creature affected.
