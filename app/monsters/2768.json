They make their homes in trees and prefer to move through the trees rather than on the ground. They have an almost human organization and society among the various tribes and clans.</p><p>Family units dwell in a single lair (usually a hollowed tree or small hut built among the branches of a leafy tree). The kech has leathery skin that on first glance resembles a covering of leaves and foliage.</p><p>Kechs attack from ambush, preferring to ensnare their prey in pits, traps, or the like. If faced with a weak adversary, they attack with a frontal assault, seeking to kill as quickly as possible. Slain prey is dragged into the kech's lair and devoured at the creatures' leisure.<br><b>Kech Characters</b><br></br> Kechs have racial Hit Dice and can have class levels.
