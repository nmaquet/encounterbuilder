A riftcreeper can only adapt to one of those four types of energy at a time-if it adapts to a new energy type, it loses its immunity to the previous type. Otherwise, the immunity lasts for 1 hour. </h5><h5><b>Gelatinous Surge (Ex)</b> Once per minute as a standard action, a riftcreeper can extrude a protoplasmic tendril of ooze to attach to any vertical surface within 120 feet. It can then transfer its entire bulk along that tendril as part of that move action to change its location to the surface to which it's now attached. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Any creatures along its line of travel are subjected to a bull rush attempt. </h5><h5><b>Strands (Ex)</b> A riftcreeper can extend up to six thin, sticky strands from its body at a time as a standard action, launching them to a maximum range of 120 feet. These attacks resolve as ranged touch attacks. On a hit, a strand deals 2d4 points of acid damage to its target and attaches to the creature. These strands are quite strong, but any amount of slashing damage severs them (a strand has AC 25). As long as a strand remains attached to a target, that creature takes an additional 2d4 points of acid damage at the start of its turn. A riftcreeper can automatically absorb the strands into its body if it uses its gelatinous surge ability (and, in doing so, it releases any attached creatures).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Heaving masses of unnatural protoplasm known as riftcreepers prowl the Worldwound's shattered canyons. Despite their name, these intelligent, malevolent oozes are quite agile and swift, slithering up and down canyon walls or swimming through even the foulest water. Natives of the Abyss, riftcreepers have adapted disturbingly well and quickly to the Worldwound. Although smart enough to understand Abyssal, riftcreepers have little interest in conversing with their food.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal (cannot speak)", "Source": "The Worldwound", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "13", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(15d8+150)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 39, Dex 27, Con 30, Int 7, Wis 16, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "6 strands +15 touch (2d4 acid and attach)", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "20 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4677, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Combat Reflexes, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Initiative, Improved Vital Strike, Power Attack, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "30, touch 14, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Riftcreeper", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +37, Swim +22", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any mountain", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +13, Will +8", "Melee": "2 slams +22 (4d6+14 plus 2d4 acid and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Gargantuan"}
