In their home environment, hydrodaemons swim the sickening rivers and seas of Abaddon and the River Styx, ducking beneath the rivers of pus and bile only to leap out at enemies and rend their flesh with tooth and claw. It is said these are among the few creatures able to survive in the deadly waters of the River Styx. When called to the Material Plane, hydrodaemons serve powerful spellcasters, protecting domains dotted with pools, streams, and even sewer complexes. Associated with death by drowning, these fiends use a favored tactic to draw the most anguish from their victims. Hydrodaemons first attack with their inky black sleep spittle, hoping to render victims unconscious. With their opponents unable to fight back, hydrodaemons drag their enemies into the foul waters they call home and delight as the liquid fills their victims' gasping lungs. If unable to drown a victim, they finish the job with jaws and claws. Hydrodaemons possess an awkward gait, springing back on their heels and leaping about like humanoid frogs. Even so, they move in an unpredictable manner, twisting their bodies with each hopping movement. Hydrodaemons can also unfurl flaps of skin that allow them to glide through the air. Hydrodaemons stand 10 feet tall and weigh upward of 3,000 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), or mob (6-12)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 15, Con 18, Int 9, Wis 11, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "sleep spittle +11 (sleep)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1144, "SubType": "(aquatic, daemon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Point-Blank Shot, Power Attack, Precise Shot, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 11, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Hydrodaemon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +0, Intimidate +14, Knowledge (planes) +10, Perception +15, Sense Motive +12, Stealth +10, Swim +21", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abaddon)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious, glide", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +9, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +13 (1d8+4 plus grab), 2 claws +13 (1d6+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 40 ft.
