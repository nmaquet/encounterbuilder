When Earthfall struck Golarion and the continent of Azlant was shattered, most of the Azlanti dwelling died in the fires or drowned in the waves. Yet a number found succor with their undersea aboleth enemies. For reasons that remain unknown to this day (but which surely have nothing to do with compassion), the aboleths rescued a small fraction of these drowning humans, warping their flesh to help them survive in the aboleths' uncontested undersea realm. Yet with that action, the aboleths seemed to lose interest, and in the thousands of years that followed, the gillmen formed a society of their own.</p><p>Physically, gillmen resemble their ancient ancestors, with expressive brows, pale skin, dark hair, and bright purple eyes. Three slim gills mark each side of their necks, near the shoulder, but they are close enough in appearance to humans that they can pass as such (for a time) without fear of detection.</p><p><b>Gillman Characters</b></br> Gillmen are defined by their class levels- they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All gillmen have the following racial traits.</p><p><b>+2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, -2 Wisdom:</b> Gillmen are vigorous and beautiful, but their domination by the aboleths has made them weak-willed.</p><p><b>Amphibious:</b> Gillmen have the aquatic subtype, but can breathe both water and air.</p><p>They prefer not to spend long periods out of the water, however, as their skin dries out very easily.</p><p><b>Enchantment Resistance:</b> See above.</p><p><b>Servitor:</b> Gillmen serve the dark, unfathomable schemes of the reclusive aboleths, but unless the gillmen go against the orders of their aboleth masters (which are often unknown to them, masked in the form of hidden memories triggered by key events), they are free to act as they wish. In a campaign, these orders are wholly up to the GM, meaning the player of a gillman character cedes some elements of self-control when it best serves the story of the campaign.</p><p><b>Water Dependent:</b> See above.</p><p><b>Languages:</b> Gillmen begin play speaking Common and Aboleth.</p><p>Gillmen with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aklo, Aquan, Azlanti, Draconic, Elven, and Sahuagin.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aboleth, Common", "Source": "Inner Sea World Guide", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, patrol (2-6), band (6-10 plus 1 lieutenant of 3rd level), company (11-60 plus 3 lieutenants of 3rd level, 2 commanders of 5th level, 1 commodore of 7th level, and 3-12 squids)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10+1)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 13, Con 13, Int 9, Wis 8, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "light crossbow +2 (1d8+1/x3)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "1", "id": 1512, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "warrior 1", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "11, touch 11, flat-footed 10", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Gillman", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +2, Swim +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-1", "Race": "Gillman", "CR": "1/3", "XP": 135, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate ocean", "CharacterFlag": "1", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +1, Will -1; +2 vs. enchantment", "Melee": "spear +2 (1d8+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
