According to lore, these creatures are named for their creators, dark and foul necromancers from an ancient civilization. Yhakkor are usually found in the employ of powerful wizards and necromancers, while others are found prowling ruins, and other such places. Yhakkor are slavering humanoid things, with feral eyes and elongated nail-claws. The rituals used in their creation have drained them of much intelligence, but greatly increased their strength. Yhakkor might easily be mistaken for ghouls, but they are not undead and have none of their weaknesses. They remember little of their former human lives. These unsavoury creatures prefer a diet of human flesh above all else. Due to their low intelligence, yhakkor are usually assigned to simple guard duty or other menial tasks. A strong-minded individual, such as a wizard, is required to control their chaotic nature. Yhakkor seem to understand Common; it is unknown if they can actually speak it. In melee, yhakkor gang up on a single opponent and attempt to tear it to pieces with their knife-like claws. Yhakkor tactics consist of attacking a foe until it is dead. Combat with yhakkor is always a savage and bloody affair.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-5) or pack (6-20)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 13, Con 18, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5104, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Stealthy, Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 11, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Yhakkor", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Escape Artist +3, Perception +6, Stealth +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land and underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +3", "Melee": "2 claws +8 (1d4+4 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
