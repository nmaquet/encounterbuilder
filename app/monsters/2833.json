The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Though not inherently evil, mongrelmen are shunned from society because of their appearance. They make their homes far from civilization, and those few encountered in settled areas are usually slaves or servants of the local humanoid races. Mongrelmen that must travel among other races take precautions so as not to reveal their true identities, using cloaks, capes, and the like to hide their forms. Mongrelman society is a collection of close-knit tribes, each with its own leader. Mongrelmen never fight against other mongrelmen, preferring to live peaceably with others of their kind, for all mongrelmen know they are shunned by outsiders and must stick together if their race is to survive. Mongrelmen stand about 6 feet tall. The average lifespan of a mongrelman is 35 years. Mongrelmen speak their own guttural language.</p><p>Mongrelmen shun combat if possible, only entering melee if ordered to do so by their superiors. In combat, mongrelmen fight with clubs or longswords. Some carry blowguns and needles or darts (the blowgun needles and darts are usually coated with bloodroot poison).<br><b>Mongrelmen as Characters</b><br> Mongrelmen possess racial Hit Dice and may have class levels.</p><p>Mongrelmen have the following racial traits.<br><b>+4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma:</b> Mongrelmen are physically gifted, but odd to behold <br><b>Darkvision:</b> Mongrelmen can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br><b>Racial Hit Dice:</b> Mongrelmen begin play with 2 levels of monstrous humanoid, which provides 2d10 HD, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saves of Fort +0, Ref +3, Will +3.<br><b>Racial Skills:</b> A mongrelman's monstrous humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 2 x (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1).Mongrelmen receive the following racial modifiers: +8 Disguise, +4 Sleight of Hand, +4 Stealth.<br><b>Racial Feats:</b> A mongrelman's monstrous humanoid level gives it one feat.<br><b>Thick Skinned:</b> Mongrelmen receive a +4 natural armor bonus.<br><b>Natural Weapons:</b> Slam (1d4).<br><b>Languages:</b> Mongrelman begin play speaking their own guttural language (Mongrelman).
