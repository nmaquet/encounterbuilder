Spring-Heeled Jack stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds. Spring-Heeled Jack keeps up a reputation for gruesome killing sprees and tends to flee the crime scene by leaping onto buildings. He subsists on raw animal meat, from deer to house rat to beetle. His knife is often his only company, and after years of self-inflicted solitude Spring-Heeled Jack considers it his best and only friend, and has taken to calling it \"Love.\" The finely wrought knife has no special properties, but is clearly of otherworldly origin and leaves strange scars that are impossible to reproduce. Chaotic and spontaneous, Spring-Heeled Jack at times lets his prey live to spread his legend. Though he doesn't commit his heinous crimes for notoriety alone, he revels in the reputation he has earned and the fear that registers in people's eyes as he pounces upon them. It is widely thought that Spring-Heeled Jack was at one point human, but lost his humanity in exchange for fiendish powers. The truth is that \"he\" is a fey creature- the best known of a race of fey creatures related to quicklings (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 227). These fey are fond of traveling to the Material Plane, where their mayhem is more feared and appreciated. To add to the mystery, they all use the same name among mortals and pretend to be the same individual.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d6+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 21, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5365, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Toughness, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Acrobatics when jumping", "AC": "16, touch 16, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Spring-Heeled Jack", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +12 (+16 when jumping), Bluff +6, Climb +9, Escape Artist +12, Perception +7, Sleight of Hand +10, Stealth +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +9, Will +4", "Melee": "mwk dagger +9 (1d3+2/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Small"}
