They are believed to be descended from or related to actual crocodiles, though scholars cannot find a link between the two somewhat related creatures. Chike usually live in small tribal villages of up to 40 individuals led by a tribal leader (usually the strongest of the group). Buildings are constructed of whatever natural resources and materials the chike can find. Larger tribes also have one or two shamans in their midst. Chike are extremely territorial, generally sharing their domain only with actual crocodiles. Some tribes however do associate with marsh-dwelling races such as lizardfolk engaging in trade and allying against common enemies. Chike are diurnal hunters, preferring the heat of the day vs. the cold and darkness of night. Favored meals include birds, fish, humans, goblins, and reptiles (including other chike if food truly becomes scarce). Being cold-blooded, a chike's metabolism allows it to survive up to 3 months without eating. Chike males stand over 8 feet tall while females stand just about 8 feet tall on average. Greenish-brown scales cover the chike's back while their sides and underbellies are generally smooth and lighter in color. Chike reproduce on average once per year with the female laying up to six eggs at a time. Eggs are buried deep within their muddy lair in a special incubation hut. The female spends most of her time with the eggs until they hatch. Both the eggs and young are protected by all adults in the tribe. Females fight to the death to protect their eggs and young. Chike are feared by many other races for their brutality and savagery in battle. These creatures prefer to use weapons and a fearsome bite, but particularly savage chike forego weapons and simply rend their opponents to pieces using their powerful claws. When hunting, chike submerge in water, leaving only their eyes and snout exposed. When their quarry moves within range, chike spring to attack. Though chike possess tails, they do not normally use them in combat.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Chike", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, raiding party (3-6 plus 2-3 crocodiles), band (7-12), or tribe (20-40 plus 4-6 crocodiles plus 1-2 dire crocodiles)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 11, Con 16, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4762, "SubType": "(reptilian)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "Croc Folk", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +8 Stealth in water", "AC": "11, touch 9, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Chike", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Perception +8, Stealth -2 (+6 in water), Swim +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm marshes and rivers", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "crocodile empathy, hold breath", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +1, Will +1", "Melee": "battleaxe +6 (2d6+4), bite +1 (1d8+2) or 2 claws +6 (1d6+4), bite +6 (1d8+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Large"}
