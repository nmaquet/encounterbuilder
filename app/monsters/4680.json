The bolt explodes upon reaching its target, creating a 20-foot-radius burst that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Like the more powerful retriever, the warmonger wasp is a construct built from the protoplasmic flesh and chaotic fecundity of the Abyss itself. Appearing as partially organic, partially metallic, warmonger wasps serve the demonic armies as air support in large battles, and the armies of the Worldwound are no exception. Their electricity-based explosions work well on battlefields where demons and mortals clash, as electrical attacks have no effect on demons. It's more accurate to say that warmonger wasps are grown rather than constructed, and while the procedure of crafting these foul constructs is beyond the ken of mortal crafters, spellcasters can conjure them to do their bidding (see below). Warmonger wasps are only intelligent enough to understand simple commands, and only ones universally associated with battlefield conditions. In the Worldwound, a large number of warmonger wasps have been left to their own devices. These \"wild\" wasps buzz through the skies, constantly watching for any non-demons to swoop down on and attack. Cultists and other worshipers of Deskari not escorted by demons are quick to speak in Abyssal and show their unholy symbols when confronted by a flight of warmongers. PCs eager to do the same can convince the wasps to leave them alone with a successful DC 20 Bluff check-provided the attempt is made while speaking Abyssal. A warmonger wasp is about 10 feet long, with a 20-foot wingspan. They weigh 1,200 pounds. <br><b>Conjuring a Warmonger Wasp</b><br> Although a warmonger wasp is not an outsider, it may nonetheless be conjured by either <i>planar ally</i> or <i>planar binding</i>. The spellcaster must take care to do so, however, using special rare incenses, the secretions of rare and violent insects, and complex diagrams inked on the floor and walls with expensive phosphorescent inks, lest the wasp attack the spellcaster upon the spell's completion. These components cost 15,000 gp and replace the usual costs associated with casting either spell (including <i>planar binding</i>'s Charisma check requirement).</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal (cannot speak)", "Source": "The Worldwound", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or flight (3-12)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 23, Con -, Int 3, Wis 13, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4680, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (poison), Great Fortitude, Improved Critical (sting), Improved Initiative, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception, +8 Stealth", "AC": "21, touch 15, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Warmonger Wasp", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +14, Perception +13, Stealth +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +9, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +15 (1d8+4), 2 claws +15 (1d6+4), sting +15 (1d6+4/19-20 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 30 ft.
