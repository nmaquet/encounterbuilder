They lack the fangs of their kin but stand taller-though they tend to be leaner-with elongated limbs, long, slender fingers, and large pointed ears.</p><p>Pesties stand between 2-1/2 and 3 feet tall and weighs 20 pounds.</p><p>Pesties do not communicate with others (even those of their own race) except through body language and crude hand signals. It is unknown whether pesties simply cannot or choose not to speak.</p><p>Unlike mites who like to swarm over enemies in a sudden rush, pesties prefer to utilize their great speed and employ hit-and-run tactics to keep opponents off-balance.<b></p><p>Pestie Society</b></p><p> Pesties often are found working with or lairing with goblins or (more usually) common mites. They are less likely to band together into large communities than their smaller cousins and have an almost kleptomanic urge to pilfer items of interest or value whenever they see them.</p><p>This tendency often leads to the pesties being driven out of whatever community they currently live in when their allies' patience reaches an end. However, the trapmaking skills of the mite complement the pesties' adeptness at speed and hit-and-run tactics so that invariably the two groups end up in cooperation again. Pesties that wear out their welcome in a goblin community face a grimmer fate, either succeeding in outrunning their pursuers or ending up in a goblin cook pot.</p><p><br><b>Pestie Characters</b><br> Pesties have racial Hit Dice and may possess class levels.
