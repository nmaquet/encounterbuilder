A nilbog gains any extra hit points above its normal total as temporary hit points, though it can never have more than twice its normal hit points. (Excess hit points are simply lost.). The nilbog can only be damaged through the use of curative magic and effects (<i>cure light wounds</i> and healing potions, for instance). Curative magic deals damage equal to the amount it would normally heal. </h5><h5><b>Spatio-Temporal Reversal (Ex)</b> A nilbog constantly emanates an aura of <i>confusion</i> in a 20-foot-radius. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or be affected as if by a <i>confusion</i> spell (caster level 4th). The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The nilbog is a goblin afflicted with a strange space-time reversal disease known as Nilbogism. The disease appears to occur when overly heavy use of magic strains the fabric of the space-time continuum and leads to some very strange localized events. The disease only affects goblins and is not transmitted by them. Nilbogs resemble goblins in appearance and are indistinguishable from them.</p><p>The nilbog favors ambushes, dirty tricks, and overwhelming odds to a fair fight. It moves within range of a foe so as to affect the creature with its spatio-temporal reversal ability.</p><p>Nilbog leaders tend to be rogues or fighter/rogues. Nilbogs worship various goblin gods of evil and can choose two of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, and Trickery. Most nilbog spellcasters, however, are adepts.</p><p>Nilbog adepts favor spells that fool or confuse enemies.<br><b>Nilbogs as Characters</b><br> Nilbogs are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice.</p><p>Nilbogs have the following racial traits.<br><b>-2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, -2 Charisma.</b> Nilbogs are quick but weak and ugly.<br><b>Small:</b> Nilbogs are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.<br><b>Fast:</b> Nilbogs are fast for their size, and have a base speed of 30 feet.<br><b>Darkvision:</b> Nilbogs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br><b>Skilled:</b> +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.<br><b>Special Attacks:</b> Spatio-temporal reversal (see above) <br><b>Special</b> Defenses</b>: Damage reversal (see above) <br><b>Languages</b>: Goblins begin play speaking Goblin. Goblins with high Intelligence scores can choose any of these bonus languages: Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, Halfling, Orc.</p><p>Credit The Nilbog originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Roger Musson.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Goblin", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (4-9), band (10-100 plus 100% noncombatants plus 1 3rd-level sergeant per 20 adults and 1 leader of 4th-6th level), warband (10-24 with worg mounts), or tribe (40-400 plus 100% noncombatants plus 1 3rd-level sergeant per 20 adults, 1 or 2 lieutenants of 4th or 5th level, 1 leader of 6th-8th level, 10-24 worgs, and 2-4 dire wolves)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d8+1)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 11, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 6", "Gear": "studded leather armor, morningstar, 3 javelins", "Ranged": "javelin +2 (1d4)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "1", "id": 2847, "SubType": "(goblinoid)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth", "AC": "15, touch 12, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Nilbog", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +5, Ride +5, Sense Motive +1, Stealth +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-1", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate plains and underground", "CharacterFlag": "1", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +1, Will -1", "Melee": "morningstar +1 (1d6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Small"}
