Weapons, armor, and other inanimate objects on its person grow proportionately with it when it changes size. This is similar to the <i>enlarge person</i> spell. An enlarged spriggan gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, and a -2 to AC. While enlarged, a spriggan cannot use its spell-like abilities or its innate sneak attack ability (though any other sneak attack it may have, such as from rogue class levels, is unaffected when it changes size).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Spriggans are among the ugliest and certainly the most foul tempered of all gnomes. At one moment a normal-sized gnome, a spriggan can grow to giant-sized in an instant, gaining immense strength and taking unsuspecting opponents by surprise.</p><p>Spriggans are, by human standards, quite homely. They have stocky bodies and sickly ochre-colored skin and dark hair of brown of black.</p><p>Male spriggans favor facial hair such as shaggy mustaches and ratty beards, but any head or facial hair they have is unkempt and filthy. Female spriggans do not have facial hair. Being unhygienic creatures, spriggans never bathe or clean their clothing or equipment. Thanks to their filthy lifestyle, spriggans reek with the foulness of dirt, body odor, and other unpleasantness. Despite being gnomes themselves, spriggans despise all of their gnomish kinfolk.</p><p>A typical spriggan stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 to 55 pounds.</p><p>An enlarged spriggan stands about 8-1/2 feet tall and weighs 500 to 550 pounds.</p><p>Spriggans make the best use of their magical abilities in combat. When several spriggans are encountered, some will enlarge themselves at the first sign of melee, while the remainder will stay Small and take advantage of their innate abilities of stealth and sneak attacks. Owing to their chaotic nature, complex battle plans are generally beyond most spriggan mobs; it is likely that some, none, or all spriggans in a mob will change size at the start of melee.</p><p>Spriggan Society Spriggan mobs are almost always comprised of males; female spriggans rarely venture out of their dismal lairs other than to gather food. Mobs of spriggan males are nomadic in nature, roving from place to place and never settling down for more than a few days unless there is promising a opportunity for rewarding raids on local communities. Female spriggan mobs are unusually stable for such chaotic creatures, often lairing in the same place for years before moving on.<br><b>Spriggan Characters</b><br> Spriggans have racial Hit Dice and can have class levels.
