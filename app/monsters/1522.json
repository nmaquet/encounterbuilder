An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6.</h5><h5><b> Corrupt Water (Sp)</b> Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence.</h5><h5><b> Crush (Ex)</b> A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus.</h5><h5><b> Speak with Reptiles (Sp)</b> A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals.</h5><h5><b> Swamp Stride (Ex)</b> A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.</h5><h5><b> Water Breathing (Ex)</b> A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation. Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear. Black dragons tend to make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in caves at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile up their filthy treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck. Black dragons prefer their food a bit rotten and will often allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before consuming it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay, making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects made from stone or metal.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic, Giant, Orc", "Source": "d20pfsrd", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(18d12+108)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 29, Dex 10, Con 23, Int 16, Wis 19, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "10 ft.
