A large flap of skin forms a cobra-like hood that runs from the back of the head, halfway down the spine. Its eyes burn like crimson embers and its long forked tongue flickers. But the creature's most unnerving features are its hands which end in viper heads complete with sharp fangs that drip with venom.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Cobra-back Inphidian</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 3</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>800</h5><h5>NE Medium monstrous humanoid (reptilian)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+3; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +10</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>18, touch 13, flat-footed 15 (+3 Dex, +5 natural)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>37 (5d10+10)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+5, <b>Ref </b>+7, <b>Will </b>+5</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>2 snake-hand bites +9 (1d4+3 plus poison)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>5 ft.; <b>Reach </b>5 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>poison (DC 16), spit poison</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>16, <b>Dex </b>17, <b>Con </b>15, <b>Int </b> 12, <b>Wis </b>13, <b>Cha </b>12</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+5; <b>CMB </b>+8; <b>CMD </b>21</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Alertness, Great Fortitude, Weapon Focus (snakehand bites)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Acrobatics +8, Craft (alchemy) +9, Perception +11, Sense Motive +8, Stealth +11</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Aklo, Common, Inphidian</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> warm forests and plains or underground</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary or troupe (1 cobra-back plus 3-5 common inphidians)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div></h5><h5><b>Spit Poison (Ex)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, a cobra-back can spit a line of inphidian poison from its mouth to a range of 20 feet.

They bully others of their own kind, and can often be found leading common inphidians on hunting excursions. They primarily function as muscle in inphidian hunting or adventuring parties and serve in inphidian communities as guards and protectors. Cobrabacks are loyal and follow orders without question.</p><p>When threatened or enraged, the hood of the cobra-back fans open just like that of a true cobra.</p><p>Cobra-backs are extremely aggressive and prone to attacking opponents on sight. Though they possess superb stealth skills, they prefer a straightahead fight rather than one that relies on trickery and guile.</p><p>A cobra-back opens combat by spitting its poison at an opponent before moving into melee where it bites with its snake-hands. Of all the inphidians, the cobra-backs are the most likely to employ inphidian gauntlets (see the sidebar above for details). Those wearing inphidian gauntlets wield longswords or spears.<br><b>Cobra-Back Inphidian Characters</b><br> <br><b>+6 Strength, +6 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, ;+2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma</b>.
