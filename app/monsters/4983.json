Even if the save is successful, the creature suffers 2d6 points of damage as the kamarupa clutches its heart. Often, a creature surviving a touch attack acquires a harmless trait or characteristic for 2d4 months. Traits can be a white streak of hair, a nervous twitch, pale complexion or dilated eyes. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Frightful Gaze (Su)</b> A kamarupa's glance creates dread in living beings, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures meeting the gaze must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or become panicked for 3d4 rounds. Even if successful, the subject becomes shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Nightmare (Su)</b> Once per night, a kamarupa places a nightmare on one creature it has encountered. They prefer to send the nightmare to particularly powerful opponents or priests night after night until the opponent dies. The target can resist the attack with a DC 17 Will save. A creature that drops any possession (while panicked) near the kamarupa suffers a -4 penalty to the save until the item is recovered. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the nightmare for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Powerless in Sunlight (Ex)</b> Kamarupas are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a <i>daylight</i> spell) and fl ee before it. A kamarupa caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a single move action each round. Kamarupas lose one-third of their hit points each round spent in direct sunlight. </h5><h5><b>Unnatural Aura (Su)</b> Animals sense the kamarupa's unnatural presence at 30 feet. They panic if forced to get closer and remain panicked while within range.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A kamarupa appears as a mockery of its former fleshbound life. Its hollow eyes and mouth are black voids, and its facial features twist and stretch into a nightmarish appearance. Kamarupa are the distorted souls of evil priests betrayed and sacrificed to their deity. Kamarupas are highly intelligent and communicate in voices similar to the screaming wind. They hate life and light. A kamarupa is roughly human-sized and weightless. A kamarupa attacks with its heart-stopping touch. It uses its incorporeal nature to move through walls, ceilings and floors to attack.
