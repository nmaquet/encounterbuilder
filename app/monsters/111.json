This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per age category of the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon's breath weapon (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the total damage dice of the pool is halved until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface. </h5><h5><b>Acidic Bite (Su)</b> At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6.</h5><h5><b> Charm Reptiles (Sp)</b> A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a mass charm monster spell that affects only reptilian animals. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.</h5><h5><b> Corrupt Water (Sp)</b> Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence.</h5><h5><b> Speak with Reptiles (Sp)</b> A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals.</h5><h5><b> Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</b> A black dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile-darkness (radius 10 feet per age category); Old-plant growth; Ancient-insect plague.</h5><h5><b> Swamp Stride (Ex)</b> A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. Hissing green acid drips from the fanged maw of this blackscaled, horned dragon.</h5><h5><b> Water Breathing (Ex)</b> A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged. <table> <tr><th>Age Category</th><th>Special Abilities</th><th>Caster Level</th></tr> <tr><td>Wyrmling</td><td>Immunity to acid, water breathing</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Very young</td><td>Swamp stride</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Young</td><td>Speak with reptiles</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Juvenile</td><td>Darkness</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>Young adult</td><td>DR 5/magic, spell resistance</td><td>1st</td></tr> <tr><td>Adult</td><td>Corrupt water, frightful presence</td><td>3rd</td></tr> <tr><td>Mature adult</td><td>DR 10/magic</td><td>5th</td></tr> <tr><td>Old</td><td>Acidic bite, plant growth</td><td>7th</td></tr> <tr><td>Very old</td><td>DR 15/magic</td><td>9th</td></tr> <tr><td>Ancient</td><td>Acid pool, insect plague</td><td>11th</td></tr> <tr><td>Wyrm</td><td>DR 20/magic</td><td>13th</td></tr> <tr><td>Great wyrm</td><td>Charm reptiles</td><td>15th</td></tr> </table> </h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation. Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear. Black dragons tend to make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in caves at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile up their filthy treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck.</p><p>Black dragons prefer their food a bit rotten and will often allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before consuming it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay, making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects made from stone or metal.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d12+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 14, Con 17, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 111, "SubType": "(water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Stealth), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 12, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Young Black Dragon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +13, Handle Animal +8, Intimidate +11, Perception +14, Stealth +16, Swim +23", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "speak with reptiles, swamp stride, water breathing", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +8, Will +7", "Melee": "bite +13 (1d8+6), 2 claws +12 (1d6+4), 2 wings +7 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "60 ft., fly 150 ft.
