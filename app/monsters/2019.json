This infuses the blades with disease from the demon's filthy spittle. Any creature struck by a schir's halberd must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract gray pox-a frightening disease that causes weakness, gray splotches on the skin, and eventual catatonia. The save DC is Constitution-based. <i>Gray Pox</i>: Halberd-injury; save Fort DC 15; <i>onset</i> 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>A schir resembles a tall, muscular humanoid with the head and hooves of a demonic goat. A ragged hide covers patches of a schir's body, usually around the forearms and lower legs, with a crestlike patch running down from the creature's crown to the nape of its neck. Schir demons are 7 feet tall, though they usually stoop and so appear shorter, and weigh 300 pounds. Also known as spite demons, schirs are among the most violent and vile-tempered inhabitants of the Abyss. Schirs are formed from the souls of mortals who either committed or framed others for heinous crimes-acts committed for the sole purpose of petty retribution. Despite such origins, schirs occupy one of the lowest orders in the demonic hierarchy, often serving as front-line infantry in demonic armies or as guards for minor demonic commanders. Although not especially intelligent, schirs are cunning warriors and able sentries. Although they prefer to charge into combat, a schir's natural jumping ability makes it a nimble enemy, capable of using its surroundings astutely. A schir will often jump on top of rocks, crumbling walls, or any other high place to hack with its disease-ridden halberd. For all of schirs' capabilities, their spitefulness makes them distrustful of any creature that has not proven its greater power and strength numerous times. A schir set loose upon the Material Plane quickly seeks to set itself up as a leader of its own army- often, schirs seek out tribes of savage humanoids and attempt to replace the current leaders. They are particularly fond of infiltrating gnoll tribes.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal; telepathy 100 ft., tongues", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 3", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (2-8)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 5, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2019, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (halberd)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics when jumping, +8 Perception", "AC": "19, touch 12, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Schir", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +10 (+18 jumping), Climb +11, Intimidate +6, Perception +13, Survival +2", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +3, Will +3", "Melee": "mwk halberd +10 (1d10+4/x3 plus disease), gore +3 (1d6+2) or gore +8 (1d6+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
