A creature with four or more class levels rises as a ghast instead. In either case, the ghoul or ghast has a 25% chance of retaining whatever class levels it had in life. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Magic (Su)</b> A marrowstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the golem, as noted below. <ul><li> A <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell <i>slow</i>s a marrowstone golem (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. <li> Effects that heal undead heal half that amount of damage to a marrowstone golem, to a limit of its full normal hit points. <li> A marrowstone golem that fails its save against a magical attack that deals positive energy damage (including the channel energy ability when used to harm undead, but not when used to heal living creatures) does not take any damage from the attack, but it loses its create spawn ability, its necrotic field aura, and the negative energy damage from its slam attack for 1d4 rounds. </h5><h5><b>Necrotic Field (Su)</b> Undead within 30 feet of a marrowstone golem gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws, increase the save DCs of their extraordinary and supernatural abilities by 2, and gain a +4 bonus to channel resistance. Positive energy effects cause only half damage to a creature within the marrowstone golem's aura. Their aura particularly strengthens ghouls and ghasts, giving them a +2 bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.</ul></h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Carved from rock hewn from the marrowstone mines of Sekamina, these golems amplify the magical radiation emitted by veins of lazurite. They can only be crafted within the necropolis of Nemret Noktoria, land of ghouls, for lazurite brought beyond its boundaries loses its potency. Binding the lazurite into the body of the golem stabilizes it and lets the construct leave the boundaries of the ghoulish city with its fell powers intact. Though the ghouls guard the secrets of making a marrowstone golem, they are sometimes known to trade their handiwork with outsiders. </h5><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION </b> A marrowstone golem's body is chiseled from a single block of marrowstone weighing at least 2,500 pounds. Marrowstone can only be found in the necropolis of Nemret Noktoria in the Darklands realm of Sekamina. Preparing the stone requires the use of exotic unguents that cost 2,500 gp. </h5><h5><b>Marrowstone Golem </b> </h5><h5><b>CL </b>11th; </h5><h5><b>Price </b>42,500 gp </h5><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION </b> </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>animate object</i>, <i>antilife shell</i>, <i>create undead</i>, creator must be caster level 11th; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Craft (sculpture) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 21; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>22,500 gp</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Inner Sea Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 11, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3563, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 9, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Marrowstone Golem", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground (Darklands)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +3", "Melee": "2 slams +14 (2d6+5 plus 2d6 negative energy)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
