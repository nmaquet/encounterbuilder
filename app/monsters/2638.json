Its scales are semi-transparent and appear razor-sharp. Its head is angular with two blade-like horns swept back across its crown. A glass fin-like crest starts near the base of its skull, runs down the center of its back and tapers off as it reaches the monster's tail. Its large wings are translucent and the sound of grating glass can be heard as the beast moves.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Glass Wyrm</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 12</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>19,200</h5><h5>N Large dragon </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+6; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +24</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>26, touch 11, flat-footed 24 (+2 Dex, +15 natural, -1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>168 (16d12+64)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+14, <b>Ref </b>+12, <b>Will </b>+11</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>reflective hide (DC 22), spell reflection; <b>DR </b>10/magic and bludgeoning; <b>Immune </b>paralysis, sleep</h5><h5><b>Weaknesses </b>vulnerability to sonic spells</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +21 (2d6+9/19-20), 2 claws +21 (1d8+6), tail slap +19 (1d8+9)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>10 ft.; <b>Reach </b>5 ft.

A creature can attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save to negate the blinding effect. This otherwise operates like a gaze attack. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Spell Reflection (Ex)</b> Any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance and targets a glass wyrm (or includes it in its area of effect) is reflected back on the caster if the glass wyrm successfully resists the spell or effect. The original caster becomes the spell's target (or its point of origin in the case of area spells). A reflected spell can be resisted normally by the caster (and any other creatures affected). A glass wyrm cannot reflect a sonic-based spell or spell-like ability, even if it allows resistance.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Glass wyrms are relatives of other dragons and are believed to have their origin on another plane of existence. They make their home beneath the surface world and enjoy the relative solitude of the underground world.</p><p>Their lairs normally consist of a maze of twisting and winding corridors meant to confuse and befuddle trespassers. Their lairs are littered with scores and scores of gemstones and broken glass (thought to come from the glass wyrm's scales).</p><p>Glass wyrms sustain themselves on a diet of gemstones and natural minerals, and rarely eat meat (though their draconic heritage does occasionally rise to the surface thereby instilling the taste for such things in them).</p><p>In battle a glass wyrm relies on their breath weapon and natural attacks, switching between them as the battle warrants. Powerful foes are always targeted first and subjected to the monster's breath weapon. Some glass wyrms keep torches or other light sources scattered about their labyrinthine lairs so they can use their reflective hide to blind trespassers and enter combat quickly before their opponents can react.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic, Undercommon", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or family (3-5)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d12+64)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 14, Con 19, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "5 ft.
