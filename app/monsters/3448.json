These creatures exist mainly on a diet of insects and small animals such as birds, shrimp, worms, and snails though some of the larger ones occasionally target small humanoids as prey. Giant archerfish are typically solitary creatures and rarely travel in schools. Schools of these fish, when encountered, do not work in concert with one another; every fish is on its own.</p><p>Giant archerfish are three feet long and have silver-colored bodies with vertical black stripes that begin just behind the head and fade as they near the tail. Their eyes are either cloudy blue or silver and its fins are slightly darker than its body. Some species of giant archerfish are yellowishgray with dark-colored eyes, but all have the vertical black stripes. Giant archerfish can grow to be five feet long.</p><p>The giant archerfish spends most of its time near the surface where it uses its water spray to dislodge potential prey from their land-based perch and knock them into the water. The archerfish then darts in and bites. This fish's eyes are formed in such a way that allows it to see perfectly into the air or on land from a depth of six feet without any distortion or refraction.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or school (6-11)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 11, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "water spray +4 (1d3)", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3448, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "Giant archerfish use their Dexterity modifier for Swim checks.", "AC": "14, touch 13, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Giant Archerfish", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +6, Swim +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +6, Will +1", "Melee": "bite +4 (1d6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
