The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence.</h5><h5><b> Speak with Reptiles (Sp)</b> A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals.</h5><h5><b> Swamp Stride (Ex)</b> A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.</h5><h5><b> Water Breathing (Ex)</b> A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation. Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear. Black dragons tend to make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in caves at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile up their filthy treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck. Black dragons prefer their food a bit rotten and will often allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before consuming it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay, making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects made from stone or metal.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic, Giant", "Source": "d20pfsrd", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d12+80)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 27, Dex 12, Con 21, Int 14, Wis 17, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "5 ft.
