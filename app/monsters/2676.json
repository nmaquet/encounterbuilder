Standing a few feet shorter than their ogre kin and a few feet taller than their human kin, half-ogres have strength as well as speed and intelligence (relative to other ogres) in their favor. Their skin and hair color generally match that of their ogre parent, with dark tones such as gray, brown, or olive being the most prevalent. Half-ogres speak Common. Those with an Intelligence score of at least 10 also speak Giant.</p><p>A half-ogre's usual weapon of choice is a greatsword or a longspear.</p><p>They sometimes employ longswords and large wooden shields.</p><p>Half-Ogre Society Half-ogres, though generally outcasts among humans and feared for their ugliness and size, can find some acceptance among ogres. Half-ogres in an ogre band need to prove themselves constantly to their larger kin, however. For this reason, half-ogres found among an ogre band are cruel, violent, and strong; weaker half-ogres usually wind up in the stew pot. Most half-ogres found among full-blooded ogres are leaders of the ogre band or are at least well on their way to becoming leaders. Their long years suffering the harsh treatment of their kin help half-ogres develop a sense of cunning and a strong will to survive. Therefore, ogres under the leadership of a half-ogre fight more effectively, even engaging in planned ambushes and complicated tactics that are beyond most ogres.</p><p>On rare occasions, half-ogres collect into hybrid communities of other half-ogre races (such as orogs and ogrillons) or humanoids (such as orcs and half-orcs). These rogue bands of outcasts form bandit clans or marauding groups that are the bane of other humanoid communities in their area.</p><p><br></br><b>Half-ogre Characters</b><br></br> Half-ogres possess racial Hit Dice and may have class levels.
