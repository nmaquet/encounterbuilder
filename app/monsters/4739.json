Similarly, any male humanoid slain by a banshee's death wail or energy drain rises to become a dread wraith in 1d4 rounds. </h5><h5><b>Lifesense (Ex)</b> Lesser banshee's can detect living creatures within 60 feet, as if they possessed the blindsight ability. In addition, the lesser banshee senses the strength and life-force of the creature, as the spell deathwatch. </h5><h5><b>Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)</b> A banshee is powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flees from it, typically by hiding within a solid object. A banshee caught in sunlight cannot attack or use its wail and can take only a single standard or move action in a round. </h5><h5><b>Unnatural Aura (Su)</b> Animals can sense the aura of a lesser banshee at a distance of 30 feet. The animal will not willingly near a lesser banshee, and panics if forced to do so. </h5><h5><b>Wail (Su)</b> A lesser banshee may let loose a wail so horrible that those within 30 feet must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or die. The lesser banshee may only use her death wail at night, and no more than twice per day. After using this ability a lesser banshee must wait for 1d6 rounds before using it again. The save is Charisma-based, and includes the bonus from the Ability Focus feat.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Lesser banshees are the spirits of departed women (especially of elven heritage) that were cruel and evil in life. Lesser banshees appear as ghostly, translucent figures, and bear the same beauty they possessed in life. Lesser banshees attack with their incorporeal touch, and drain the energy of their foes. They are most widely known for their horrible keening (death wail), and fondness for attacking from solid objects. Lesser banshees cling to areas they were familiar with in life; many lesser banshees may be found in dark forests or rolling moors; rarely, their incorporeal nature allows them to travel to new places, and such creatures become interred in dungeons or mausoleums, completely unaware of where they are or why they are there. This infuriates the banshees even more, and makes them far deadlier opponents.
