Three times per day, so long as the golden cat is within 40 feet, the owner can reroll one die roll and take the most favorable result. Only one die can be rerolled each round. This ability is a power of the cat, not the owner, though the owner can simply telepathically communicate its desire to the cat. A golden cat cannot be forced to activate this ability if it does not wish to do so (unless magically compelled). Each time the golden cat activates this ability and the owner rerolls a die, all other creatures (including the owner's allies) within 40 feet of the golden cat must reroll one die roll and take the least favorable result each time.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>These fickle creatures are highly sought after due to their magical ability to grant luck to one fortunate enough to be selected as an owner.</p><p>Such owners are known to spend extravagant amounts of wealth keeping the golden cat lavishly protected and comforted. Despite this, golden cats have been known to grow bored with an owner and strike out on their own in search of a new owner to bestow its good luck upon.</p><p>While prized by their owners for the luck they bestow, golden cats are equally despised by the owner's allies for the bad luck they bring.</p><p>Golden cats tend to lair in forested areas or hilly terrain, usually near civilized lands where the population is the greatest (it makes finding an owner easier). They favor humans and elves as owners above all other races, disdaining the less civilized races such as orcs, half-orcs, goblinoids, and so on. A golden cat never takes one of the aforementioned races as an owner.</p><p>A golden cat appears as a normal cat with rich golden fur and green eyes. Like all cats, a golden cat enjoys catching mice, rabbits and small birds. They tend to avoid attacking things larger than themselves unless cornered and defending themselves. Even then, they seek escape as soon as possible.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (cannot speak); telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(2d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 8, Dex 15, Con 10, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2643, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics when balancing or jumping, +4 Stealth.
