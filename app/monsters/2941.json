Any melee hit or constriction attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's clothing and armor (non-metal only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 19 Reflex saves. A wooden weapon that strikes a white pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless it succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. If a white pudding remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 19 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Camouflage (Ex)</b> Since a white pudding looks like normal ice and snow when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the white pudding. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice a subterranean-dwelling white pudding. </h5><h5><b>Corrosion (Ex)</b> An opponent that is being constricted by a white pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor. </h5><h5><b>Suction (Ex)</b> The white pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A white pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a white pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A variety of the black pudding, the white pudding is found only in cold, frigid lands. It is white in color and uses this to its advantage by ambushing its prey.</p><p>White puddings attack by grabbing and constricting their prey. A white pudding waits motionless for its prey to move within range before striking.</p><p>Credit The White Pudding originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "-2", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(9d8+54)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 1, Con 21, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2941, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "3, touch 3, flat-footed 3", "Swim": "0", "Name": "White Pudding", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-2", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold plains and underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "camouflage, suction", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref -2, Will -2", "Melee": "slam +7 (2d6+4 plus 2d6 acid plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., climb 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
