All creatures within a 30-foot spread of a shrieking mandragora must make a DC 15 Will save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting ability. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerable to Supernatural Darkness (Ex)</b> In areas of supernatural darkness (such as those created by <i>deeper darkness</i>, but not by darkness), a mandragora is <i>slow</i>ed, as the <i>slow</i> spell.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>A mandragora rises spontaneously from a mandrake root that has drawn nutrition from the corpse or ichor of a demon. A typical mandragora stands at just over 3 feet tall and only weighs 30 pounds. However, its size hides the creature's fantastic strength and brutality. When a mandragora attacks, its fingers grow into whipping, thorny vines nearly 10 feet long, with which it makes its slam attacks.</p><p>A mandragora rarely strays far from its lair amid tangled roots or vines, but when it encounters any other creature, it attacks regardless of the odds. However, a mandragora can usually recognize druids and does not attack them or their animal companions unless they attack it first. It has no qualms about attacking a druid's allies.</p><p>When mandragora poison is mixed with its thick, gooey, sap-like blood and 1,000 gp worth of alchemical reagents, the resulting fluid can be used as a focus for the <i>scrying</i> spell. The fluid only lasts for the duration of the spell's casting time and resulting effects but the subject of the spell takes a -4 penalty on the save to resist it.</p><p>A mandrake root that is growing on or near a demon's corpse or ichor has a 2% chance of awakening as a mandragora within a day of first absorbing the tainted material. A creature that wants to create a mandragora can do so with alchemy; the process requires a day of work, a mandrake root, several pints of ichor or the body of a demon of CR 6 or above, and a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check. The newly created mandragora is hostile, even to its creator.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or grove (3-12)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(5d8+15)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 18, Con 17, Int 8, Wis 13, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.
