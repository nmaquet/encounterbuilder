Additionally, the wielder can cast <i>waves of fatigue</i> once per day (CL 15th).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Vepar is an Abyssal duke in the serv<i>ice</i> of Dagon, Prince of the Sea. He leads 29 battalions of shrroths in serv<i>ice</i> to his master. He is a brooding particularly mortals (whose very existence he disdains). His loyalty to Dagon is questionable at best, for behind the scenes, Vepar is quietly amassing an army of demons to one day lead against his current lord. But for now, he waits and serves.</p><p>Vepar's citadel, <i>Leviathan's Reach</i>, is built into an underwater mountain range that sits several miles below the surface of his watery Abyssal home.</p><p>The citadel is guarded by scores of aquatic demons, fiendish merfolk, and fiendish tritons, as well as several hundred sahuagin led by a fiendish sahuagin 15th-level sorcerer named Anaunon. Most visitors (those that can actually reach it) avoid this place.</p><p>Vepar resembles a 12-foot tall merman. His upper torso is copperybrown while his lower torso and fins are silver and scaled. Vepar's hair is long and black, and he usually wears it tied back or braided. His eyes, usually blue in color, burn with a silvery fire when he is angered or excited. Under his hair, two small copper horns can be seen just above his eyes. Vepar's hands end in wicked claws with silvery nails.</p><p>Vepar relies on his trident, spell-like abilities, and ability to deal ability damage when combating foes. Before entering combat, he often raises a storm (using <i><i>control</i> weather</i> or <i><i>control</i> winds</i>) to herald his coming, though he is just as likely to attack from ambush or surprise as he is to \"announce\" his arrival. He enters combat with <i>unholy aura</i> active and follows it closely with <i><i>ice</i> storm</i>.</p><p>Copyright Not<i>ice</i> Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Aquan, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal, Undercommon; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Vepar plus 2-5 shrroths)", "Ref": "21", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(22d10+242)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 33, Dex 26, Con 33, Int 27, Wis 27, Cha 29", "Gear": "Demonbrand", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2468, "SubType": "(aquatic, chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Deceitful, Great Fortitude, Improved Critical (trident), Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (ice storm), Weapon Focus (claw), Weapon Focus (trident)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "26", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "37, touch 26, flat-footed 29", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Vepar", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +38, Diplomacy +31, Disguise +35, Escape Artist +30, Intimidate +31, Knowledge (arcana) +30, Knowledge (geography) +30, Knowledge (planes) +33, Knowledge (religion) +30, Perception +45, Sense Motive +37, Stealth +29, Survival +30, Swim +22, Use Magical Device +31", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "15", "Race": "", "CR": "21", "XP": 409600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +26, Ref +21, Will +15", "Melee": "+2 trident +35/+30/+25/+20 (2d6+13/19-20) or 2 claws +33 (1d8+11 plus hypothermic touch)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
