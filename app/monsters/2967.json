Creatures adjacent to the spore rat must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. The cloud lasts a single round. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Spores (Ex)</b> The bite of a spore rat injects a living creature with miniscule spores that cause nausea for 1 round. A successful DC 11 Fortitude save negates the nausea. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Spore rats are thought to be the result of an ancient ensorcelled experiment involving giant rats and one or more unknown plant or fungus creatures. No evidence exists to prove or disprove this theory however, so very little is known as to their true origin.</p><p>Spore rats favor damp environments such as rainforests and swamps where they build their nests and lairs from the underbrush, overgrowth, and mud or slime. A typical lair contains 10 or more creatures, with males dominating the pack nearly 2-to-1. Females generally avoid combat and confrontation unless the entire nest is threatened. Both males and females always fight to the death if defending their young. If threatened, a spore rat releases a spore cloud in an effort to detour would be aggressors. Failing this, it lashes out with its bite attempting to nauseate its opponents. Given the chance, a spore rat flees combat unless cornered.</p><p>Spore rats exist on a diet of plants, berries, and various funguses and lichens. Food is gathered by the hunters (almost always males) and carried back to the lair where it is stored in holes for future use (during the cold months and to feed the young). A typical spore rat hunting band often journeys up to 1 mile from its lair if no closer food source can be found.</p><p>A spore rat is typically up to 3 feet long and weighs about 30 pounds.</p><p>Its fur is greenish-brown and is not actually fur at all, but tightly packed funguses and mushrooms. Its eyes are ruby red or pale yellow. Its claws and teeth are always filthy and are brownish-white in color.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pack (4-8), or infestation (9-18)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(3d8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 6, Dex 16, Con 11, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 4", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2967, "SubType": "(fungus)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "uses Dex to modify Climb and Swim", "AC": "16, touch 14, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Spore Rat", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +12, Perception +8,", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +4, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +6 (1d4-2 plus spores)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., climb 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
