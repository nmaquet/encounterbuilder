Typically, the oolioddroo uses <i>modify memory</i> immediately after an oviposition, making its victim forget the violation. The egg gestates in the victim's brain for 24 hours, after which a small caterpillar-like larva emerges and nestles painlessly into the victim's brain. At this point, the oolioddroo can track the victim's location as if the victim were under the effect of a <i>status</i> spell, can communicate telepathically with the victim across any distance, and can use its <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>modify memory</i>, and <i>suggestion</i> spell-like abilities through the link to target the victim. The larva (and link to its oolioddroo) becomes inert whenever the victim and the oolioddroo are on separate planes. Victims carrying this larva detect as chaotic and evil. Anyone who reads the victim's thoughts, such as via <i>detect thoughts</i> or telepathy, can attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by the oolioddroo's Bluff check to notice the presence of a second, alien set of thoughts in the target's mind. <i>Dispel chaos</i> and <i>dispel evil</i> immediately ends the oviposition- the implanted larva melts into harmless fluid and is absorbed by the victim's body. This is not a disease effect, though, so <i>heal</i> or <i>remove disease</i> offer no aid in ending the effect. As an immediate action, an oolioddroo can use its <i>feeblemind</i> spell-like ability on the carrier-it uses this \"scorched earth\" tactic if it fears that the host is about to be rescued or cut off from its influence, such as occurs when the effects are ended via <i>dispel chaos</i> or <i>dispel evil</i>. Using <i>feeblemind</i> in this way automatically destroys the larva, regardless of whether or not the victim saves against the <i>feeblemind</i> effect, so an oolioddroo typically waits until the last moment to use this ability. </h5><h5><b>See Thoughts (Su)</b> An oolioddroo can see a creature's thoughts, interpreting them as a shifting mass of images, colors, and shapes that infuse a creature's aura. An oolioddroo gains the effects of see <i>invisibility</i> against creatures with an Intelligence score as a result of this unusual sense. This ability also grants the oolioddroo a +8 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks. When it uses <i>detect thoughts</i>, it does not have to study an area or subject to gain all 3 rounds of information-it gains all of this information on the 1st round of using the ability. In addition, it gains a +4 racial bonus on the save DC of its <i>detect thoughts</i> spell-like ability. A blind oolioddroo loses the ability to see thoughts. </h5><h5><b>Shadow Mantle (Su)</b> The supernatural shadows that wreathe an oolioddroo grant the creature a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks and a +4 deflection bonus to its Armor Class. </h5><h5><b>Thought Siphon (Su)</b> Whenever an oolioddroo damages a creature with its tongue attack, it can drink away one of the creature's thoughts or memories. A creature can resist this attack with a successful DC 23 Will save. On a failed save, the oolioddroo chooses to target the victim with one of the following effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. <i>Memory</i> <i>Drain</i>: The victim is immediately affected by the oolioddroo's <i>modify memory</i> spell-like ability. The oolioddroo can adjust up to 5 minutes of memories immediately-it does not need to increase the spell's casting time to match the duration of the <i>modified memory</i>. <i>Skill</i> <i>Drain</i>: The victim loses all skill ranks in a skill of the oolioddroo's choosing for 24 hours. Lost skill ranks can be recovered immediately with a <i>restoration</i> or greater <i>restoration</i> spell. <i>Spell</i> <i>Drain</i>: The victim immediately loses one prepared spell or one unused spell slot of the oolioddroo's choice; this lost spell or spell slot can be replenished normally. <i>Wisdom</i> <i>Drain</i>: The victim takes 2 points of <i>Wisdom</i> drain. </h5><h5><b>Tongue (Ex)</b> An oolioddroo's tongue attack is a primary attack that does piercing and slashing damage. Whenever an oolioddroo damages a foe with its tongue, it can use its thought siphon attack.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Oolioddroos, known also as moth demons, are a particularly insidious breed of fiend that can infest the brain of a living creature with their eggs, allowing them to manipulate creatures' thoughts and minds from afar. Sometimes an oolioddroo's victim can go for months or even years before the demon capitalizes on the link and forces the victim to undertake a particularly nefarious or vile deed. In the worst cases, the victim can commit crimes or heinous acts at the oolioddroo's bidding and then immediately forget about these acts, creating the perfect sleeper agent who not only unknowingly does the oolioddroo's bidding, but might even be significantly involved in efforts to oppose the acts of sabotage and terrorism the oolioddroo commands. To the oolioddroo, the torment, shame, and despair a victim feels upon realizing he's been at least somewhat responsible for the actions is as delicious and delightful as the pain and suffering caused by the acts themselves. An oolioddroo appears as a skeletally thin woman with gray flesh. Its shadow mantle typically appears in the form of a flowing, diaphanous, black gown, but the demon can control the shape of this supernatural defense to make it appear as regular black clothing or simply its own shadow. The oolioddroo's face is that of a horned moth, and her tongue, while flexible, can penetrate flesh and bone with ease. An oolioddroo stands 6 feet tall, but only weighs 100 pounds. These sinister demons form from the souls of those who used brainwashing, mind-control, and similar techniques, either magical or mundane, to trick or force the innocent into committing terrible acts of brutality. An encounter with an oolioddroo can be rather complex, especially if a PC is its intended victim. If an oolioddroo attempts to seize control of a lone PC, one tricky tactic is to simply ask the character's player to attempt all the necessary rolls and checks beforehand. Typically, one of these demons attempts to implant eggs in a sleeping or lonely character, so you can just have that character make a Perception check (at a -10 penalty if the character is sleeping) and a saving throw against the <i>modify memory</i> spell-if both fail, you can continue with the assumption that the implanted egg hatches without the player noticing. Thereafter, the source of the strange voices and compulsions in the character's thoughts, as well as the source of the periodic <i>suggestion</i>s and other magical attacks, can be as frighteningly mysterious to the player as well as the character. Of course, you should take care not to go too far with this-if the PC or an ally uses <i>detect evil</i>, for example, don't forget to give them the clue that something strange is going on when a normally non-evil PC radiates an unexpected aura!</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic; telepathy 300 ft.", "Source": "The Worldwound", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or cult (3-6)", "Ref": "16", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(14d10+98)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 25, Con 24, Int 21, Wis 24, Cha 23", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4671, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Lightning Stance, Mobility, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (invisibility), Spring Attack, Weapon Finesse, Wind Stance", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception, +8 Sense Motive, +4 Stealth", "AC": "28, touch 22, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Oolioddroo", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +21, Bluff +23, Diplomacy +23, Fly +32, Knowledge (arcana) +22, Knowledge (planes) +22, Perception +32, Sense Motive +32, Spellcraft +22, Stealth +28, Use Magic Device +23", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "16", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +16, Will +16", "Melee": "2 claws +21 (1d4+2), tongue +21 (1d6+2 plus thought siphon)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 40 ft.
