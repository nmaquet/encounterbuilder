Each time a creature suffers damage from a living monolith's acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 27 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a living monolith takes 2d6 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 27 Reflex save. If a living monolith remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 27 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Spawn Offspring (Ex)</b> Every 1d4 rounds, a living monolith spawns 1d6 crawling offspring from its form, but 1d6 of these are instantly destroyed or reabsorbed by the living monolith. (See the Crawling Offspring entry below.) </h5><h5><b>Tentacles (Ex)</b> A living monolith can transfer a grabbed opponent from a tentacle to one of its mouths as a move action.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The living monolith, sometimes called a monolith of fecundity, is a slow-moving pillar of amorphous flesh dripping with slime. Along its gigantic bulk are several gaping mouths and writhing pseudopods. This loathsome being is usually brought forth by the summoning spells of clerics who worship perverse fertility deities. At irregular intervals its flesh breaks open and instantly regenerates as the living monolith spawns twisted offspring that crawl and slither away from its progenitor. Some of these spawn are instantly disintegrated by the acidic slime dripping from the monolith or torn to pieces by pseudopods and ravenous mouths, but a few scuttle away and survive (see the crawling offspring entry). A living monolith thrashes mindlessly at opponents with its tentacles. When disturbed, it constantly seeps its acidic slime which is as likely to destroy its crawling offspring as inflicting damage on opponents. An opponent unlucky enough to be grabbed by a flailing tentacle is shoved into one of the living monolith's maws and swallowed whole, subjected to the monster's deadly digestive acids.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(18d8+144)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 32, Dex 6, Con 26, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "ooze", "Reach": "20 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4996, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "24, touch 4, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Living Monolith", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +4, Will +1", "Melee": "4 tentacles +20 (2d6+11 plus 2d6 acid and grab) or bite +20 (4d8+24 plus 2d6 acid; only against grabbed foe)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Gargantuan"}
