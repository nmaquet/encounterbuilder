Creatures attacking a gelid beetle unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits. </h5><h5><b>Cold Spray (Ex)</b> Once per day a gelid beetle can release a spray in a 10-foot cone that deals 2d4 points of cold damage. Those within the cone who succeed a DC 13 Fortitude save take only half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Gelid beetles inhabit icy forests and other such desolate places in arctic climates. They spend most of their time hunting, surfacing from their lairs at night to prey on giant or smaller insects. During the daylight hours, gelid beetles like to congregate with others of their kind in warm spots where the sunlight breaks through the trees.</p><p>Gelid beetles make their lairs in hollowed logs, dead trees, and other such hidden places. During the mating season, the female digs a small underground chamber in a well-secluded place and lays 1d4+1 silverywhite eggs. These eggs hatch in about 2 weeks producing olive-yellow larvae. The larvae spends its time feeding and growing (and occasionally molting) before passing into the pupa stage after nearly 3 weeks in its larval stage. The pupa sheds its skin for the last time after 8 to 10 days and emerges as an adult gelid beetle.</p><p>Most beetles are white with silvery-black legs and dull silver mandibles.</p><p>Some specimens have a mottled silver or black carapace and an even rarer species has dull crimson wing covers.</p><p>A lesser gelid beetle begins combat with its cold spray. It then charges into combat biting its opponents. Though not intelligent, these creatures often employ hit-and-run tactics, especially when attacking as a group.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "-", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "cluster (2-5) or colony (6-11)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 1, Wis 10, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2622, "SubType": "(cold)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth in natural surroundings", "AC": "17, touch 10, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lesser Gelid Beetle", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +8, Stealth +5 (+9 natural surroundings", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +4, Will +1", "Melee": "bite +6 (1d4+2 plus 1d4 cold)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
