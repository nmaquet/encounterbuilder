The target loses the majority of memories relating to life and identity, and the hyakume can control the creature as if it were subject to a <i>charm monster</i> spell until those memories are regained (Will DC 28 negates). The hyakume absorbs the memories and can store and use them. It can store the memories of a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence bonus (typically 4) at one time. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Eye Probe (Su)</b> Once per day as a full-round action, a hyakume can detach up to six of its eyes and send them on missions. An eyeball has AC 22, hp 5, and a fly speed of 60 ft. with perfect maneuverability. A hyakume can see through all of its eye probes, and can make drain memory attacks with them. If a hyakume's eyeball is destroyed, the hyakume takes 5 points of damage. An eye probe can't stray farther than 1 mile from a hyakume or the eye is destroyed (dealing 5 points of damage). </h5><h5><b>Monk Abilities</b> The hyakume's Stunning Fist feat and slam attacks function as though it were a 15th-level monk. It can also use the quivering palm class feature once per day (Fortitude DC 25). The save DC is Wisdom-based. </h5><h5><b>Transfer Memories (Su)</b> Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can touch a willing creature with either its hand or one of its eye probes to transfer memories it has stored to the creature touched. This is a mind-affecting effect.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Hideous and corpulent, with numerous eyes dotting their bodies, hyakumes are mystics of malevolence.
