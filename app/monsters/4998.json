These creatures are highly territorial, nocturnal and spend most of the day sleeping in their lair or sunning themselves on large tree limbs where the sun breaks through the treetops. Giant forest lizards dine on other forest animals, consuming almost anything they find. When food is scarce, they scavenge as well. A typical giant forest lizard's territory covers several square miles. A giant forest lizard is 9 feet long and weighs nearly 2,000 pounds. Its coloration and markings are browns and greens, allowing it to adapt and hide in the forests. These creatures mate but once a year with the female depositing up to four eggs in the lair. Eggs hatch within 3 months and young reach maturity within 10 months. Forest lizards can live to be 20 years old. When hunting, a giant forest lizard perches within the trees on strong, overhanging limbs. When potential prey passes beneath it, it drops to the ground and attacks. Prey that is killed is carried back to its lair and eaten or saved for later consumption. In combat, or when warning other creatures that have entered its territory, the giant forest lizard vocalizes, emitting a deep, rolling hissing sound.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pack (2-5)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(8d8+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 15, Con 19, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4998, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics when jumping, +4 Stealth in undergrowth", "AC": "19, touch 11, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Giant Forest Lizard", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +6 (+14 jumping), Climb +18, Perception +11, Stealth +3 (+7 in undergrowth)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "powerful leaper", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +8, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +12 (2d6+9 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
