Turning and running only incites the pack for they know that no normal creature can outrun them (without the aid of magic).</p><p>Ronus always hunt in large packs. A solitary encounter with a ronus is almost unheard of. In such events, the creature encountered is most certainly injured, sick, or old. Such a creature will not attack, unless provoked and only fights to defend itself.</p><p>Ronus live by hunting and are carnivorous monsters. They will eat just about anything from mice to rabbits to goblins to ogres; anything they can catch and kill. Prey is attacked quickly and dispersed as quickly as possible before it has a chance to get its bearings and mount an attack against the ronus pack. Kills are eaten where they fall. The pack ravenously devours most of the meat, but do not pick the bones clean.</p><p>Area scavengers appreciate this and some actually follow a ronus pack waiting for its chance to eat.</p><p>Ronus packs build their lairs in hard to find areas and often use leaves, fallen trees, and broken tree limbs to camouflage the lair. Ronus are social creatures and a lair typically contains 1-4 packs. If young are present, there will be 2d4 of them; they are noncombatants.</p><p>Ronus are fast and use their quickness to their advantage when hunting.</p><p>They often sight their prey from a great distance and rely on their closing speed to catch it before it notices the ronus and has a chance to flee. Prey that tries to escape is run down; very few creatures can outrun a hungry ronus.</p><p>These creatures also use \"flush\" tactics to force prey into a trap. For example, a pack may chase their prey for a short distance before most of the pack seems to break off and give up. One or two continue pursuit, forcing the prey to turn this way or that way; in essence, forcing the prey to go the way the ronus want it to go. Prey that fall for this tactic often wind up face-to-face with the rest of the ronus pack.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "pack (4-9) or lair (6-11)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 19, Con 15, Int 4, Wis 14, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2976, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "17, touch 14, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ronus", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +8, Perception +10, Stealth +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +7, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +7 (1d6+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "60 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
