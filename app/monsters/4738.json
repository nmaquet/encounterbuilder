Its natural form is that of a baboon, but it can also take the form of a human or human-baboon hybrid. A baboonwere's human form is fixed-it cannot assume different human forms. A baboonwere can only use its diseased bite in hybrid or baboon form. In baboon form, it functions as a baboon. In its hybrid form, a baboonwere can make a bite attack as a secondary attack, while in human form it lacks its bite entirely. A baboonwere can shift into any of its three alternate forms as a move action. Equipment does not meld with the new form between human and hybrid forms but does between those forms and its baboon form. </h5><h5><b>Disease (Ex)</b> <i>Filth Fever</i>: Bite-injury; save DC 13 Fort; <i>onset</i> 1d3 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Weapon Intuition (Ex)</b> A baboonwere is proficient with simple and martial melee weapons.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Baboonweres are evil baboons born with the ability to assume human or hybrid human form. Baboonweres are most often found among normal baboons, though some prefer to maintain their human form and live amongst ordinary people in small towns and villages. Usually when the livestock and cattle begin turning up missing or slain is when the baboonwere moves on, before the finger of suspicion is pointed its way. In its hybrid form, a baboonwere stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 130 pounds. Its hair tends to be either light brown or dark brown. Eyes are always brown. Baboonweres fight with weapons, usually longswords, short swords, and spears or crossbows and a diseased bite. Slain foes are dragged back to their lairs and eaten at the baboonwere's leisure. Baboonweres are frequently found among normal baboons and are indistinguishable from them when in animal form. The statistics for a standard baboon may be found in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 2.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, gang (1-2 plus 6-10 baboons), or troop (3-6 plus 10-20 baboons)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d10+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4738, "SubType": "(shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Acrobatics, +2 Bluff, +2 Climb, +2 Survival", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Baboonwere", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +5, Bluff +4, Climb +3, Perception +5, Stealth +7, Survival +4", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm forests and plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "baboon empathy, change shape", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +1", "Melee": "longsword +5 (1d8+1), bite +0 (1d6 plus disease) or bite +5 (1d6+1 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
