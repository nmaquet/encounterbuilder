They are aggressive creatures whose sole purpose seems to be to kill and devour any living creature that stumbles into their territory.</p><p>Cave leeches often lair with others of their kind. Food is not shared among them, so each leech is effectively on its own when hunting prey. Quarrels over prey sometimes erupt between cave leeches lairing together; these disputes end when one of the leeches backs down or is driven away.</p><p>An adult cave leech measures about 8 feet long and its whip-like tentacles are each about 6 feet long. Cave leeches are often mistaken for ordinary giant leeches, especially when at rest because the creature folds its tentacles back against its body. They also do this when waiting to strike.</p><p>When a meal comes within range, the cave leech fires a tentacle out and attempts to grab its target. Grabbed prey is pulled in to the cave leech's mouth and bitten by its horrible teeth. Living creatures trapped by its tentacles are held and bitten, the leech draining blood with its bite.</p><p>A victim that is completely drained of blood becomes a dried, rotting husk and its body is cast aside. Foes killed by its bite attack are often dragged to the cave leech's lair and fed to the young or drained of blood over several days. A cave leech sometimes uses the rotting husks of its victims to line its lair.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pack (2-5)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+24 plus 8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 11, Con 17, Int 3, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.
