This ability can be dispelled, but the elusa hound can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Using this ability, the elusa hound can instantly identify any spellcaster within range. </h5><h5><b>Aura Tracking (Su)</b> If an elusa hound has \"tasted\" the magical aura of a living creature (a creature it has successfully used its <i>arcane sight</i> ability against or a spell it has successfully detected that was cast by such a creature), it gains a +10 competence bonus to its Survival check when tracking that target. The aura must be fresh (\"tasted\" within the last 3 hours) or the elusa hound does not gain this bonus.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Elusa hounds are used by different creatures for different reasons; though ultimately there have but one purpose: tracking (and often killing) magic-wielders. These creatures can detect the emanations given off by arcane and divine spellcasters and use this scent to track them. The origins of the elusa hounds have mystified even the most learned of sages, for though they seem to be born of magic, no spellcaster in his or her right mind would ever create such a beast.</p><p>Renegade bands enthralled with the idea of ridding the world of spellcasters sometimes employ them. Civilized towns and cities likewise use them in places where magic is forbidden or policed by the local government. In other instances, they are used by spellcasters to ferret out rivals.</p><p>When given instructions to track and kill their target, a pack of elusa hounds uses tactics similar to other canine animals: circle the prey and attack simultaneously from the front, rear, and flanks. These beasts can easily be trained to pin or hold a foe rather than kill it. This tactic is often employed by military or government units when they wish to capture and interrogate a renegade spellcaster. When using these tactics, the elusa hound attempts to trip its foe and then pins it with a bite.</p><p>Elusa hounds radiate a moderate aura of divination magic if examined with <i>detect magic</i> or the like.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "understands Common (but cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (4-7)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2582, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Skill Focus (Survival)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "Survival +4 when tracking by scent", "AC": "15, touch 12, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Elusa Hound", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +8, Survival +10 (+14 tracking by scent)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests and plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "aura tracking", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +6 (1d6+3 plus trip)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
