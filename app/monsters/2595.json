Any melee hit deals fire damage. Creatures attacking a fire phantom unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage each time their attacks hit. </h5><h5><b>Fire Blast (Su)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a fire phantom can hurl a small globe of elemental fire to a range of 30 feet (no range increment). By making a successful ranged touch attack, it deals 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature hit must make a successful DC 15 Reflex save to avoid catching on fire. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Immolation (Su)</b> Normally used as a last resort, a fire phantom can detonate itself in an inferno of elemental fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. This instantly kills the fire phantom if it fails a DC 20 Will save. Even if the fire phantom survives, its flames are extinguished for 1 minute. During this time the fire phantom cannot use its fire blast ability and cannot deal fire damage with its slam attack. It retains the fire subtype. After 1 minute, its fires relight and it may deal fire damage normally and use its fire blast ability. If the fire phantom survives the immolation it may not use it again for one day. </h5><h5><b>Rage (Ex)</b> A fire phantom is in a constant state of agony from the elemental fire that consumes its body. Therefore, it is always in a berserk rage and gains Str +4 and -2 AC (both already included in the statistics block above). The fire phantom cannot end this rage voluntarily and it cannot be suppressed or negated.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>When a creature dies on the Elemental Plane of Fire, its soul often melds with part of the fiery plane and reforms as a fire phantom; a humanoid creature composed of rotted and burned flesh and elemental fire. Fire phantoms desire nothing more than to return to the Material Plane and destroy as many living creatures as possible by consuming them in the same flames that now house their spirit.</p><p>Fire phantoms are encountered in areas where fires are already burning (campfires, pyres, vigils, etc). They step through a portal from the Plane of Fire into a fire on the Material Plane. This fire must be at least Small or larger; else any attempt by the fire phantom to enter the Material Plane through that fire automatically fails. Once it enters the plane, it often lies in wait in the fire for potential victims to come near it. A fire phantom hiding inside a fire is difficult to see requiring DC 25 Perception check.</p><p>A fire phantom waits inside its fire until it spots a living creature. It then rushes out, shrieking and hurling globes of fire. If faced with overwhelming odds or facing certain destruction, the fire phantom either moves as close as possible to as many foes as possible or attempts to draw in as many of its opponents as possible and uses it immolation ability.</p><p>In normal melee, the fire phantom alternates between hurling globes of fire and pummeling a foe with its burning fists. When a fire phantom is wounded, flames dance and play around the wound. Fire phantoms fight until destroyed or all opponents are dead or flee.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8 plus 7)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 14, Con -, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "fire blast +7 touch (2d6 fire)", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2595, "SubType": "(extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 10, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Fire Phantom", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +9, Perception +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Elemental Plane of Fire", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +4, Will +6", "Melee": "2 slams +10 (1d4+4 plus 1d6 fire))", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
