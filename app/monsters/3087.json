Known as ngogas, these half-orangutan, half-cyclops hybrids are infamous in the folktales of the Mwangi peoples, who fear them for their unpredictability and unnatural agility. In cyclops legends, the ngogas were a gift to the Ghol-Gani from their otherworldly patrons near the collapse of the empire, magical beings infused with the brutality and insight afforded cyclopes, but lacking the intelligence that would make them viable competitors. Ghol-Gani soldiers often trained these beasts to follow them into battle and fight alongside them, and present-day cyclopes who encounter ngogas inevitably feel a sort of kinship to the similarly monocular beasts, enticing them with gifts of fruit and meat in order to gain an ally in their destructive conquests. Since the fall of Ghol-Gan, ngogas have proliferated throughout the dense jungles of central Garund, and many of their kind can be found as deep as Usaro, where the destructive Gorilla King trains them as war-mounts for his smaller minions and relies on their bestial speed to stage ambushes against any who would dare t o intrude upon his realm.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Lost Kingdoms", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or band (3-5)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(9d10+36)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 20, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3087, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Bull Rush, Improved Initiative, Improved Iron Will, Iron Will, Rending Claws*", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 14, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ngoga", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +20, Perception +7, Stealth +7", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm jungles", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +11, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +14 (1d8+6), 2 claws +14 (1d6+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., climb 40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
