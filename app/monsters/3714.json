Other mokele-mbembe are immune to this effect.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The mokele-mbembe is a predatory saurian that measures up to 40 feet in length and weighs up to 10 tons. Inhabitants of the deep tropics, mokele-mbembe dwell in lakes, rivers, swamps and other aquatic regions where they feed on fish, birds, small mammals, and even reptiles. When food runs short and mokele-mbembe grow hungry, they have been known to seek prey from local tribes and villages. Despite being an aggressive hunter, a mokele-mbembe shares some traits with nonpredatory sauropods. Its body is massive and elephantine, with four long legs that end in webbed feet. Its neck is long and flexible like that of herbivorous dinosaurs or giraffes, but its head is triangular, with strong jaws and sharp teeth like a carnivore. A mokele-mbembe's hide is mottled greenish-brown and has the texture of tree bark. Large, defensive spines grow from its back. The mokele-mbembe's natural habitat normally lies far from populous regions. For this reason, they are rarely glimpsed by outsiders, though they are well known to locals who hunt in such lands. Many stories are told about the creatures' size, strength, and ferocity, and some groups even believe them to have a special sacred status as messengers of the gods-or agents of their wrath.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Mystery Monsters Revisited", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (3-6)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(14d8+56)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 13, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "15 ft.
