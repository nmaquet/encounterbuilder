Living creatures in the area take 2d6 points of negative energy damage each round. A successful DC 19 Fortitude save negates the damage that round. A new save must be made each round. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Enervating Ray (Su)</b> Once per round and no more than three times per day, as a standard action, a dreadweed can fire a ray of negative energy at a single target to a range of 30 feet. This ray functions as an <i>enervation</i> spell (CL 8th). Each time a dreadweed uses this ray, it suppresses its enervating aura for 1d4 rounds. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> DC 19 Fort; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Con damage; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Vines (Ex)</b> A dreadweed can extend up to four vines from its body at a time, launching them to a maximum range of 20 feet. A dreadweed's attacks with its vines resolve as ranged touch attacks. These vines are quite strong, but can be severed by any amount of slashing damage (a vine is AC 20).If a dreadweed uses its pull ability to pull a target within reach of its bite attack, it can immediately make a free bite attack with a +4 bonus on its attack roll against that target.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A dreadweed is a strange plant creature that grows on unholy ground. Infused with negative energy, it feeds on any living creature it encounters. A dreadweed never stops growing as long as it is able to find food, so in the right cursed soil these plants can grow to truly monstrous proportions. At rest, a dreadweed resembles a matted, chaotic tangle of vines and undergrowth, filled with old sticks, briars, thistles, and nettles. Once roused, however, the dreadweed pulls together into a vaguely humanoid shape and emits a chilling aura that saps the life from living creatures. A dreadweed is about 6 feet tall but only weighs 75 pounds. A dreadweed attacks with its vine-like tentacles, tearing at its prey and injecting a powerful poisonous sap with its bite attack. It often attacks in ambush, leaping towards its victim in a swirl of lashes. During battle, a dreadweed can focus its negative energy aura into a powerful ray that further damages its foes.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or cluster (2-8)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d8+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 17, Con 21, Int 4, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "4 vines +10 (1d6+4 plus 1d4 negative energy plus pull)", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.
