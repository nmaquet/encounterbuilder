Once a creature makes a saving throw against a particular cythnigot's horrific appearance, that creature is immune to the horrific appearance of all cythnigots for 24 hours. A spellcaster that has a cythnigot as a familiar is immune to the horrific appearance of all cythnigots, and also gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against any qlippoth's horrific appearance. </h5><h5><b>Spores (Su)</b> Any creature bitten by a cythnigot must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or become infested by the creature's otherworldly spores. These spores cause twitching spikes and hideous pallid growths of hair-like fibers to erupt from the bite wound and to writhe and wrap around the target's limbs. A creature suffering from these spores is entangled, and can attempt a new DC 11 Fortitude save in later rounds as a standard action to rip the tendrils free and escape the entangled condition. The effects of multiple cythnigot bites on a creature do not stack. Plant creatures take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives within the corpses of small animals. The fungus transforms the host corpse in hideous ways, adding legs or rearranging features-a rat might gain an extra pair of legs and an insectoid visage, while a cat could lose all its legs and fur and gain a snake-like body. The only thing that all cythnigots have in common is a long stalk of fungal material that extends up from the creature's body, ending in a surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws. A cythnigot without a host body appears as little more than a foul-smelling puff ball the size of a human's fist.</p><p>Chaotic evil spellcasters of caster level 7th who have the Improved Familiar feat can gain a cythnigot as a familiar-to do so, the spellcaster must already have a Tiny animal as a familiar.</p><p>Infusing this familiar with the spores results in a cythnigot that is a loyal, if rather disgusting, minion of the spellcaster.</p><p>A cythnigot is about 20 inches long and weighs 10 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal; telepathy (touch)", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or bloom (2-12)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 12, Con 11, Int 11, Wis 8, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1324, "SubType": "(chaotic, evil, extraplanar, qlippoth)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Cythnigot", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +7 (+11 jump), Fly +15, Knowledge (nature) +6, Knowledge (planes) +6, Perception +5, Stealth +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +6 (1d6+1 plus spores)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
