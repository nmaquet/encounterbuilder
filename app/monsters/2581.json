This breath weapon is effective both on the surface and underwater. </h5><h5><b>Capsize (Ex)</b> An elemental water dragon can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the elemental water dragon's size, it takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check. </h5><h5><b>Drench (Ex)</b> The elemental water dragon's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can <i>dispel magic</i>al fire it touches as <i>dispel magic</i> (caster level equals elemental's HD). </h5><h5><b>Water Mastery (Ex)</b> An elemental water dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foes are touching water. If the opponent or elemental water dragon is touching the ground, the elemental water dragon takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) </h5><h5><b>Transparency (Ex)</b> When submerged, an elemental water dragon is effectively invisible (DC 35 Perception check when near the surface only) until it attacks.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>From the Plane of Water comes the elemental water dragon (also called water wyrm by some sages). They make their homes in the deep oceans of the Material Plane and are rarely found far away from large expanses of water. An elemental water dragon is composed entirely of water and commands respect from the more intelligent sea creatures as well as those humanoids that ply their trade upon the waters. Elemental water dragons are evil and take great pleasure in demanding sacrifice from those that dare enter their realm. If the sacrifice placates the dragon, it lets the creature pass unabated; otherwise, it attacks with all of its might and most often destroys those that offend it or fail to appease its desires. Water dragons take great pleasure in capsizing and sinking ships. Particularly evil water dragons may accept a sacrifice and then sink the ship of those that crossed its path anyway. On occasion, a group of skum or other evil aquatic creatures can be found allied with an elemental water dragon, but this alliance is usually short-lived and often shaky. It generally ends with the elemental water dragon feeding on its former allies.</p><p>Elemental water dragons prefer to fight in or near water where they can use their transparency and water mastery abilities to full advantage. They prefer to attack from ambush, often lying in wait for their opponents and then springing from the waves to assault their foes.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "17", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(24d10+120)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 29, Dex 16, Con 20, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.
