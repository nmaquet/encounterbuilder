An ettercap gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Spiders are mindless, but this empathic communication imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing ettercaps to train giant spiders and use them as guardians.</h5><h5><b> Traps (Ex)</b> The ettercap is particularly skilled at crafting cunning traps with its webs. Deadfalls, nooses, and spear traps are the most common traps ettercaps build with their webs. An ettercap doesn't require gold to build its traps, merely time. Rules for crafting traps can be found in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.<br> <b>Ettercap Deadfall:</b> CR 3; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; Effect +10 melee (4d6), multiple targets (all targets in a 10-ft. square).<br> <b>Ettercap Noose:</b> CR 1; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; Effect +15 CMB check (grapple).<br> <b>Ettercap Spear Trap:</b> CR 2; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; Effect +15 melee (1d6+6).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Ettercaps are typically 6 feet tall and weigh about 200 pounds. They are solitary creatures and rarely group with others of their kind, even to mate. When they do group, they tend to attract a variety of different spiders, forming a strange collective of ettercaps and arachnids.</p><p>Ettercaps are known for building cunning traps out of webs and other natural materials, using them to trap prey.</p><p>They build shelters out of webbing, often high up in the trees away from other ground-based predators, and use monstrous spiders as lookouts and guardians.</p><p>Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their traps often ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap does engage its enemies, it attacks with its claws and venomous bite. It usually refuses to come within melee reach of any foe that is still able to move, and flees if an opponent gets free.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or nest (3-6 plus 2-8 giant spiders)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(4d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 17, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 15, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 179, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 on Craft (trapmaking)", "AC": "15, touch 13, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ettercap", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +14, Craft (trapmaking) +8, Perception +9, Stealth +7", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "spider empathy +7", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +4, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +5 (1d6+2 plus poison) and 2 claws +5 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
