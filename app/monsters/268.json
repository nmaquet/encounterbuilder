A merfolk's lower body consists of the fins and tail of a great fish.</p><p>Depending on the region, the scales of merfolk vary in hue, including gleaming silver, pale green, or even blue with stripes of yellow and crimson. Merfolk typically measure 6 to 8 feet in length and weigh over 200 pounds, with females being slightly smaller than males.</p><p>Although amphibious, merfolk move only with difficulty on land and rarely wander more than a mile from sea.</p><p>It is quite rare for a merfolk to make contact with a creature not of its kind. In fact, many go to great lengths to steer sailors away from their lands, even resorting to violence if necessary. Ancient accounts hint at merfolk protecting a terrible secret bound to the depths, and though no reports mention what this secret is, the lengths merfolk go to remain isolated from other races highlight the importance of this safeguard.</p><p>While merfolk outwardly appear to be a beautiful and powerful race, some sages and seafarers whisper that degenerate and mutated merfolk roam the deepest, most isolated regions of the seas and oceans. Some evidence states that this offshoot fell to the worship of twisted and sinister powers lurking in the darkness below, while other theories include all merfolk in this sinister agenda, holding that even those merfolk who believe they control their own destinies are, in fact, merely unknowing puppets of a sinister and unknown master race deep under the sea.</p><p><b>Merfolk Characters</b><br> Merfolk are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All merfolk have the following racial traits.</p><p><b>+2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma:</b> Merfolk are graceful, hale, and beautiful.</p><p><b>+2 Natural Armor:</b> Merfolk have tough skin.</p><p><b>Aquatic:</b> Merfolk are aquatic and can breathe water.</p><p>Their land speed is 5 feet, but their swim speed is 50 feet. They are amphibious, but prefer not to spend long periods out of the water.</p><p><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> All merfolk have low-light vision.</p><p><b>Languages:</b> Merfolk begin play speaking Common and Aquan. Merfolk with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aboleth, Aklo, Draconic, Elven, Sahuagin, and Sylvan.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, company (2-4), patrol (3-10 plus 2 lieutenants of 3rd level and 1 leader of 3rd-6th level), or shoal (11-60 plus 1 sergeant of 3rd level per 20 adults, 5 lieutenants of 5th level, 3 captains of 7th level, and 8-12 dolphins)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "heavy crossbow +2 (1d10 (19\u201320)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "1", "id": 268, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "warrior 1", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "13, touch 11, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Merfolk", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +3, Swim +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-1", "Race": "Merfolk", "CR": "1/3", "XP": 135, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate ocean", "CharacterFlag": "1", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +1, Will -1", "Melee": "trident +2 (1d8+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., swim 50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
