Artificial illumination or light spells of 2nd level or lower do not negate this ability. </h5><h5><b>Superior Low-Light Vision (Ex)</b> A shadow wing can see five times as far as a human in dim light.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Shadow wings are nocturnal predators formed of inky blackness that resemble a cross between a giant hawk and giant tailless manta ray. They are fierce hunters, and once prey is sighted, shadow wings are relentless in their pursuit. A typical shadow wing hunter claims a territory in a 5 mile radius around its lair. To the shadow wing, any living creature entering this area is fair game. The common shadow wing makes its lair within a secluded and hard to reach cave high in mountainous regions. A typical nest contains 2 adults and 1d4 newborns or 2d4 eggs. Shadow wing eggs are blackish-blue in color and soft and leathery to the touch. Shadow wings prefer to scout for food under the cover of darkness when their shadow blend ability is the most useful. Using its superior vision it almost always sights its target before they ever know the shadow wing is there. Prey is killed and either devoured on the spot or carried back to the lair. A shadow wing measures 9 feet long and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Its body is composed of darkness and shadowstuff and it resembles a manta ray with a hawk's head. Its beak is formed of the same inky blackness as the rest of its form. Other than two piercing red eyes no other discernible features can be made out in its form. Shadow wings speak with a low, raspy voice. A shadow wing attacks by swooping low at an opponent and slashing it with its wings or stabbing with its beak. Since most attacks instigated by shadow wings occur under the cover of darkness, they use their shadow blend ability to conceal themselves from their foes.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, flock (2-5), or roost (3-6)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 21, Con 18, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5054, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Greater Flyby Attack, Flyby Attack, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception, +8 Stealth in darkness", "AC": "23, touch 14, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Shadow Wing", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +8, Perception +18, Sense Motive +3, Stealth +11 (+19 in darkness)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +12, Will +4", "Melee": "bite +13 (2d6+4), 2 wings +8 (1d8+2 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., fly 80 ft.
