Often living in the shade of larger trees, or in the wasteland of a destroyed forest, lightning treants are strange, angry creatures whose powers and talents are almost elemental in nature. Confused by some travelers with shambling mounds, these creatures are much larger and the moss-like vegetation they are covered with is only a thin layer over their hard wooden core.</p><p>While many types of treants might make an effort to negotiate, or at least try to determine whether or not travelers might be hostile to whatever forest they are living in, lightning treants tend to simply attack first and, quite frankly, not question anything. Using their ability to <i>call lightning storm</i>s, these creatures can be a true bane to travelers, especially those that do not recognize them at first.</p><p>Lightning treants have an inherent hatred of all humanoids and attack them on sight. If there are more than one or two in a group the lightning treant starts combat with a <i>chain lightning</i> spell and then uses <i>call lightning storm</i> to have further <i>lightning bolt</i>s ready; afterward, the lightning treant charges into combat, focusing first on anyone with an axe or other slashing weapon. If combat goes against it, it uses <i>lightning bolt</i> on its enemies, as well as using bolts called down with <i>call lightning storm</i> to heal itself or hurt its opponents.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Casey Christofferson.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or grove (4-8)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d8+84)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 9, Con 24, Int 11, Wis 17, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3116, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Greater Sunder, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Survival)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+16 Stealth in forests", "AC": "22, touch 7, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lightning Treant", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Knowledge (nature) +4, Stealth -2 (+14 in forests), Survival +7", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +3, Will +7", "Melee": "2 slam +16 (2d8+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Huge"}
