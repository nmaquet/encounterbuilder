The <i>astral</i> projecting creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or be snapped back to its body, ending the spell effect but not harming the spellcaster. The save DC is Wisdom-based. </h5><h5><b>Disk Rider (Su)</b> A shulsaga can only use its fly speed in tandem with its <i>floating disk</i> spell-like ability. A shulsaga that casts <i>floating disk</i> can use the spell to its normal effect, or step upon it and use it to fly for the duration of the spell. The disk can support its creator and the creator's equipment (even if this exceeds the load a <i>floating disk</i> can normally bear), but nothing else. Only the disk's caster can ride it in this way. A <i>floating disk</i> cast by a shulsaga is dismissible. </h5><h5><b>Sense Rift (Su)</b> As a standard action, a shulsaga can detect any planar rift within 20 miles, automatically learning its direction and distance. This includes natural portals, non-instantaneous planar spells such as <i>gate</i>, and other tears in reality.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Natives of the Astral Plane, shulsagas wish only to be left in peace to ride and hunt the wild voids. Life is rarely so easy, though, as predatory outsiders, mortal travelers, and souls making their passage to the Outer Planes constantly trespass upon the shulsagas' home plane. Proud and territorial, the disk-riders use their intimate understanding of <i>astral</i> forces to drive interlopers from their territory. Shulsagas live in a simple but far from primitive hunter society, based around drifting villages that float upon stray chunks of elemental detritus and <i>astral</i> protomatter. They often train the massive beasts of their native plane (such as <i>astral</i> leviathans) to pull and defend their unfettered homes. Because shulsagas endlessly face the deadly beings that travel the Astral Plane, most communities attack strangers rather than risking their lives trying to distinguish friends from foes. Shulsagas speak a raspy dialect of Auran. A shulsaga is born genderless. It reaches maturity when it's a century old, and can then will its body toward a gender it will have for the rest of its life. Shulsagas can live to be over 500 years old, but most die earlier in hunts or planar upheavals. They average 7 feet in height and weigh about 240 pounds. Many have levels in ranger or summoner.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, hunting party (3-6), warband (7-22)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 19, Con 10, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "mwk longbow +9 (1d8/x3)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5356, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Point-Blank Shot", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 14, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Shulsaga", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +11, Fly +19, Knowledge (planes) +8, Perception +10, Ride +11, Stealth +11, Survival +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Astral Plane)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "disk rider, sense rift", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +8, Will +7", "Melee": "mwk trident +6 (1d8+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.
