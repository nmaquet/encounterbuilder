Its head is horrifically human-like in appearance, but completely hairless, having neither hair, nor eyebrows, nor lashes. Its teeth are long and pointed and its tongue is forked and brown in color. Its shark-like pectoral fins end in three-fingered claws and it has two dorsal fins, side-by-side. Its tail fins curve sharply and are a bit lighter in color than the rest of its body.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Renzer (Devilfin)</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 6</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>2,400</h5><h5>CE Large magical beast (aquatic)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+6; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., keen scent, low-light vision; Perception +10</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>19, touch 11, flat-footed 17 (+2 Dex, +8 natural, -1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>68 (8d10+24)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+8, <b>Ref </b>+8, <b>Will </b>+6</h5><h5><b>SR </b>17</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>Swim 60 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +9 (1d8+2 plus grab) and two claws +9 (1d6+2)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>10 ft.; <b>Reach </b>5 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>command fish</h5><h5><b>Spell-Like Abilities</b> (CL 8th)</br>At will&mdash;<i>control water</i>, <i>water breathing</i> (others only)</br>2/day&mdash;<i>cone of cold</i> (DC 17 half) (can be used underwater)</h5></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>17, <b>Dex </b>15, <b>Con </b>14, <b>Int </b> 10, <b>Wis </b>15, <b>Cha </b>14</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+8; <b>CMB </b>+11; <b>CMD </b>23 (cannot be tripped)</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Toughness</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Intimidate +10, Perception +10, Swim +19; <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+8 Swim</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Aquan, Common</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> temperate and warm aquatic</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>none</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div></h5><h5><b>Command Fish (Su)</b> Twice per day, a renzer can command fish and aquatic creatures as the <i>mass charm</i> spell (caster level 8th).

Thought to be the result of a wizard's deadly experiment gone awry, the renzer hates most other forms of life and attacks them on sight.</p><p>Renzer are a malevolent and vile race and care little for anyone one, including others of their kind. They are solitary, selfish creatures that derive great pleasure from killing other creatures, and so they spend a large amount of time hunting prey; sometimes for food, other times for the thrill of the hunt. Most intelligent races avoid the renzer, but some have actually in recent times opened trade with these creatures. Certain colonies of sahuagin trade goods and services with them, though the deals prove shaky at best. Even the sahuagin don't really like or trust the renzer.</p><p>A renzer usually initiates combat with its spell-like abilities, using a <i>cone of cold</i> to blast its foes. In melee combat, a renzer focuses on bite attacks and once it locks its teeth on an opponent, it rarely lets go until either it or its opponent is dead. If fighting a surface-dwelling race or air-breathing creature, a renzer often grabs the opponent and dives straight down, swimming as fast as it can in hopes of drowning the foe. If outnumbered or overwhelmed, the renzer moves a safe distance away and uses its command fish ability.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2972, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "Devilfin", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Swim", "AC": "19, touch 11, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Renzer", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +10, Perception +10, Swim +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +8, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +9 (1d8+2 plus grab) and two claws +9 (1d6+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "Swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
