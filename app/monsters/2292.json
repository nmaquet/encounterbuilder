It can use this ability once per round to affect one creature. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or fall into loud bickering and arguing with those around him. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds. Fighting begins 1d4 rounds into the bickering and lasts 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based. </h5><h5><b>Foresight (Su)</b> A carbuncle has a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This ability is always active and cannot be negated or dispelled.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Deep in the tangled underbrush of forests and in the remote regions of dismal swamps and bogs lives a strange creature called the carbuncle. The carbuncle is a withdrawn creature and seeks to avoid encounters. Should it seek interaction, a carbuncle often begins by proudly announcing the value of the gem in its forehead just to watch the reaction such information arouses.</p><p>Despite its overall shy nature, the carbuncle has a mischievous side as well, often seeking to join travelers in order to play pranks and gauge the reactions of the unfortunate victims of its curiosity. After joining with a party, a carbuncle will seek to cause discord by using selective telepathic images and prophesies to breed hostility and suspicion between party members. It will often telepathically contact nearby monsters and lead them to attack the party so that it can watch in fascination and read the thoughts of the party as they are attacked, slipping away at an opportune moment.</p><p>A carbuncle can be coerced to surrender the gem in its forehead. This requires a successful DC 20 Bluff check. If successful, the carbuncle releases the gem. If the check fails, the carbuncle sees through the deception and attempts to flee. When a carbuncle is slain, its forehead gem crumbles to dust. If the carbuncle relinquishes its gem, it grows another one within one month.</p><p>Though fascinated by combat, carbuncles are nearly helpless in melee.</p><p>They much prefer to set up encounters using their powers and then watch the brutal scenes unfold. Carbuncles surrender immediately if attacked. If placed under duress, a carbuncle wills itself to die. A favorite tactic of the carbuncle is befriending a party and accompanying them on their quest.</p><p>Once it has achieved this objective, it uses its discord ability to cause suspicion, hostility, and disruption among the party members.</p><p>Credit The Carbuncle originally appeared in the First Edition Fiend Folio (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Albie Fiore.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d8+1 plus 3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 7, Dex 10, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 18, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2292, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Toughness, Weapon Finesse B", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Carbuncle", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Escape Artist +4, Knowledge (any) +4, Perception +8, Stealth +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "1/2", "XP": 200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +2, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +1 (1d3 -2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
