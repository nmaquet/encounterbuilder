They cannot die from natural causes. They still need to eat, sleep, and breathe, and can be killed normally. </h5><h5><b>Poison Use (Ex)</b> A sprite is never at risk of poisoning itself when handling poison. They use sprite poison on their arrows. </h5><h5><b>Speak with Animals (Su)</b> Sprites can communicate with animals as the spell of the same name. This innate supernatural ability is always active and cannot be negated or dispelled.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A reclusive folk, sprites live in meadows and woodland glens, where they have appointed themselves the monitors of their lands. They stand about 2 feet tall and fly by means of their tiny diaphanous wings. Sprites have very delicate features with tiny, upturned noses and large pointed ears. Their eyes sparkle like moonlight on a forest lake, and their tiny, high-pitched voices sound almost like music.</p><p>Sprites are shy and reclusive, avoiding contact with other races; only druids have regular contact with sprites, and indeed many druids get their training from sprites. However, sprites detest evil and attack it on sight with their weapons, preferring to strike from ambush while invisible. If possible, they render their victim unconscious using their envenomed arrows, then spirit the creature away to some remote location where it is placed without weapons or gear and left to fend for itself. Creatures that have demonstrated especially evil characteristics may be slain outright, however.</p><p>Unlike their pixie cousins, sprites are not especially mischievous by nature, and prefer to be left alone.</p><p>Sprite Poison: <i>Type</i> injury; save DC 15; frequency 1/ min. for 2 min.; effect unconscious 1 minute/ 2d4 hours; cure 1 save.</p><p>Sea Sprite Sea sprites are the aquatic version of normal sprites. As their name implies, they are joyful fey who dwell in the sea. Their hair resembles strands of seaweed and they have large, fish-like eyes. The skin of a sea sprite is pale blue. Lacking wings, sea sprites cannot fly, but thanks to fine webbing in their fingers and toes they are adept swimmers. Sea sprites can breathe both air and water without difficulty. Like normal sprites, sea sprites make use of special ammunition that put their opponents to sleep.</p><p>Sea sprites have the same statistics as their land-dwelling brethren, with the following exceptions: They have the aquatic and amphibious subtypes; they do not have a fly speed but have a swim speed of 30 feet, and their Swim score is +12 (Swim score is based on their Dexterity, not their Strength). They employ crossbows rather than shortbows, and prefer spears over short swords.</p><p>Credit The Sprite originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Sprite: Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p><p>Sea Sprite: Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Elven, Sylvan; speak with animals", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-4), band (6-11), or tribe (10-100)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d6+1)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 8, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 16, Cha 16", "Gear": "short sword, shortbow, 20 poisoned arrows (sprite poison)", "Ranged": "shortbow +5 (1d4/x3 plus poison)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3032, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Weapon FinesseB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 16, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sprite", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +7, Craft (any one) +5, Fly +13, Knowledge (local or nature) +5, Perception +7, Perform (any one) +7, Sense Motive +7, Stealth +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "immortal, poison use", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +6, Will +5", "Melee": "short sword +5 (1d4-1/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 50 ft.
