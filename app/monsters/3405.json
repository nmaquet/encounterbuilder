It has a peaked and craggy shell from which protrude four long fins and a scowling head at the end of a long neck. Rather than a turtle's head, however, this creature's head has irrefutably shark-like features. It has round, black eyes and a gaping maw filled with rows of razor sharp teeth.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Turtle-shark</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 6</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>2,400</h5><h5>N Huge magical beast (aquatic)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+3; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +9</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>21, touch 11, flat-footed 18 (+3 Dex, +10 natural, -2 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>63 (6d10+30)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+10, <b>Ref </b>+8, <b>Will </b>+2</h5><h5><b>Defensive Abilities </b>shell</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>10 ft., swim 40 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>bite +13 (2d6+8 plus grab), slam +12 (1d8+8)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>15 ft.; <b>Reach </b>10 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>capsize, swallow whole (1d8+8 plus 1d6 acid damage, AC 15, 6 hp)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>26, <b>Dex </b>16, <b>Con </b>21, <b>Int </b> 2, <b>Wis </b>10, <b>Cha </b>8</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+6; <b>CMB </b>+16 (+20 grapple); <b>CMD </b>29</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Cleave, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (bite)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Perception +9, Swim +16</h5><h5><b>SQ </b>amphibious</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any aquatic</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary or pair</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>incidental</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Capsize (Ex)</b> A turtle-shark can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the turtle-shark's size, it takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check. </h5><h5><b>Shell (Ex)</b> If severely threatened, a turtle-shark can completely withdraw into its shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When withdrawn, a turtle-shark gains a +8 bonus to its Armor Class and a +4 bonus on Reflex saves.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A turtle-shark is a giant hybrid animal, which many think is a product of the same twisted magic that created the owlbear.
