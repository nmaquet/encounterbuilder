This touch attack has a range of 60 feet and no range increment. A creature struck by a cave fisher's filament becomes attached to the sticky thread. As a standard action, a creature can rip the filament free with a DC 20 Strength check. A caught creature can also attempt to escape a filament by making a DC 25 Escape Artist check. A filament is AC 14 (touch 12), has 5 hit points, and has DR 15/slashing. An application of liquid with high alcohol content (or a dose of <i>universal</i> solvent) dissolves the adhesive and releases the creature caught by the filament. A cave fisher can have only one filament active at a time.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The cave fisher lairs on ledges and cliffs underground, where it can quickly strike and reel in its prey. Its lair is always littered with bones and gear from its previous victims. The cave fisher is a 7-foot long insect-like creature with a hard outer shell. The cave fisher's snout fires a strong, web-like adhesive filament it uses to reel in its prey. Often, the ground and walls nearby are covered with this filament.</p><p>The cave fisher's preferred method of attack is to anchor itself to its ledge and string its filament across the ground of its lair. When a living creature touches or passes near the filament, the fisher attempts to trap it and reel it in. If the cave fisher fails this, it can fire its filament at an opponent up to 60 feet away. Another favored method of attack for the cave fisher is to secret itself in a crack or a ledge above a cavern and dangle its filament down onto unsuspecting creatures passing below it (DC 20 Perception check to notice the filament).</p><p>Credit The Cave Fisher originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>A4 In the</i> <i>Dungeons of the Slave Lords</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Lawrence Schick.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(3d8+9)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 12, Con 17, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 4", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "filament +3 (drag)", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2298, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Cave Fisher", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +2, Will +1", "Melee": "2 claws +5 (1d4+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., climb 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
