The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>Strategists and masterminds of Hell's armies, the insectile ice devils possess some of the most cruelly ingenious minds in Asmodeus's legions. It is said that each ice devil-known as gelugons among the ranks of devilkind-bears within its chest a stolen, frozen mortal heart, which allows it to make decisions free of all emotion. Born on the icy layer of Cocytus, Hell's seventh layer, most ice devils migrate to Caina, the eighth layer, where they plot world-damning machinations from courts of freezing steel. Although they are perhaps the most alien and monstrous in appearance of all devils, few breeds are accorded greater respect.</p><p>In combat, a gelugon prefers to let its minions engage foes in melee so that it can hang back and appraise the foe's tactics, strengths, and weaknesses. The ice devil supports its minions with its spell-like abilities, always taking care to avoid impacting its minions in the area of effect of its spells-this not from any sense of camaraderie, only a cold and logical truth that its allies can survive longer in a fight if they are not exposed to friendly fire.</p><p>Gelugons stand at 12 feet tall, and weigh approximately 700 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, team (2-3), council (4-10), or contingent (1-3 ice devils, 2-6 horned devils, and 1-4 bone devils)", "Ref": "14", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(14d10+84)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 21, Con 22, Int 25, Wis 22, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 93, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (spear)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "32, touch 14, flat-footed 27", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ice Devil", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +22, Bluff +22, Diplomacy +22, Fly +13, Intimidate +19, Knowledge (planes) +24, Knowledge (any three others) +21, Perception +27, Sense Motive +27, Spellcraft +21, Stealth +18, Survival +23", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "12", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Hell)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +14, Will +12", "Melee": "+1 frost spear +21/+16/+11 (2d6+10/x3 plus 1d6 cold plus slow), bite +14 (2d6+6), tail +14 (3d6+3 plus slow)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
