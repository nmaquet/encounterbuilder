Such events occur within 1d6 days of the sighting of a grey spirit. Note that the grey spirit does not cause this catastrophe, rather she predicts it. </h5><h5><b>Ravages of Death Gaze (Su)</b> Any living creature that sees the face of a grey spirit suddenly knows her pain, frustration, and rage, and has glimpse of the anguish of what it is like to die broken hearted. Any opponent experiencing this tragic emotion must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be stunned for 2d6 rounds. A creature stunned by a grey spirit is wrought with despair, weeping and wailing uncontrollably. A <i>calm emotions</i> spell ends this effect. This is a mind-affecting effect A creature who succeeds on the save cannot be affected by the same grey spirit's gaze for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the grey spirit's Ability Focus feat. </h5><h5><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a grey spirit through simple combat: the \"destroyed\" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a grey spirit is to confront her with irrefutable evidence of her loved one's death. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different grey spirit by the GM.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Many a sailor who ventures out into the trackless sea is destined never to look again on the loved ones he left behind. Either death or the lure of foreign lands keeps them from returning to those who wait patiently for them. A grey spirit, usually female, is the shade of someone who died heartbroken and alone, pining away on shore and ultimately dying of a broken heart while waiting for the return of a loved one from across the sea. A grey spirit attacks any creature that approaches her, her rage and frustration at having lost her loved one knowing no bounds. In melee, a grey spirit fails wildly with her ghostly arms and hands, screaming and cursing all the while. If an opponent proves to be particularly strong, a grey spirit pulls aside the cowl that covers her face.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d8+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 16, Con -, Int 11, Wis 11, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4969, "SubType": "(incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (gaze), Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (incorporeal touch)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 17, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Grey Spirit", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +11, Intimidate +13, Perception +12, Sense Motive +9, Stealth +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "harbinger", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +5, Will +5", "Melee": "incorporeal touch +8 (2d6 cold plus energy drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 30 ft.
