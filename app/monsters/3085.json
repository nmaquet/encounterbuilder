Those cats that rose from the dead- either because of the foul magical energies of a pharaoh's crypt or thanks to the necromantic magic of a restless undead pharaoh herself-were known as ubashki.</p><p>Ubashki were prized for being stealthy, agile, and preternaturally perceptive sentries that made for effective spies and watch guards for the tombs of Osirian god-kings. Emperors often filled their crypts with the bodies of strangled and mutilated cats before they themselves were entombed, believing that a feline's suffering in life would translate to strength in undeath.</p><p>Whether or not such theories were true is up for debate, but those felid creatures that did rise from death with their masters were indeed beasts to be reckoned with, and a sizeable pack of the mummified things could very well spell the end for would-be tomb raiders. Ranging from tiny housecats to desert-roaming mountain lions, the feline enshrined with a deceased pharaoh varied in type depending on the predilections of its master, but all were known to be signif icantly more powerful than their living iterations.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Lost Kingdoms", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or nuisance (3-5 swarms plus 1 ubashki lynx)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d8+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 5, Dex 17, Con -, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3085, "SubType": "(swarm)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Climb, +4 Stealth", "AC": "15, touch 15, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ubashki Swarm", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +5, Perception +5, Stealth +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm deserts", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +6, Will +3", "Melee": "swarm +7 (1d6 plus distraction and disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Tiny"}
