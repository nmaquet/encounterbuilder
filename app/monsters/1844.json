Should the aerial servant fail the mission it has been assigned, it returns to the caster and attacks him. The aerial servant can find the caster as long as they both are on the same plane of existence. If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster returns or the aerial servant enters the plane the caster is on, the link is immediately reestablished and the aerial servant moves at full speed toward the caster''s current location. Only when the aerial servant or caster is destroyed, is the link permanently broken. </h5><h5><b>Natural Invisibility (Su)</b> This ability is constant, allowing an aerial servant to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and is not subject to the <i>invisibility purge</i> spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint it, the aerial servant gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving, or +40 when standing still-these bonuses are not included in the statistics above. This ability does not function when an aerial servant is on the Astral Plane or Ethereal Plane, but instead grants the creature concealment (20% miss chance). </h5><h5><b>Wind Blast (Su)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, an aerial servant can release a blast of wind in an 80-foot line. A creature struck takes 4d8 points of damage and those up to the aerial servant''s size or smaller are knocked down and back 2d10 feet. An affected creature can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save to reduce the damage by half and avoid being knocked down. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Aerial servants are semi-intelligent creatures from the Plane of Air that often roam the Astral and Ethereal planes. They normally are only found on the Material Plane as a result of being summoned by a cleric (or, less frequently, a wizard) using the <i>greater planar ally</i> or <i>greater planar binding</i> spell and commanded to perform some task, often being required to use their immense strength to carry objects or aid the summoner. Though an aerial servant performs whatever task is asked of it, it resents being summoned and forced to do another''s bidding; therefore, it attempts to pervert the conditions of the summoning and its mission. An aerial servant that fails or is thwarted in its mission becomes insane and immediately returns to the caster who summoned it, either killing the caster or carrying the caster back to the Plane of Air with it.</p><p>Aerial servants are invisible on the Plane of Air. On other planes, they can be seen when they wish, though only vaguely, and appear as humanoids composed of whitish-gray vapor. Sometimes eyes, a nose, and a small mouth form in the vapor.</p><p>Aerial servants attack by using a shearing blast of wind as a weapon or by grabbing an opponent and crushing it within their powerful grasp.</p><p>Aerial servants can only be killed on their native plane. If slain elsewhere, they simply dissolve into wisps of vapor and return to their home plane.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "14", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+72)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 22, Con 23, Int 4, Wis 10, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1844, "SubType": "(air, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Survival", "AC": "24, touch 16, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Aerial Servant", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +20, Knowledge (planes) +5, Perception +19, Stealth +20, Survival +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Air)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "improved tracking, link with caster", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +14, Will +10", "Melee": "2 slams +19 (2d8+6 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "60 ft., fly 60 ft.
