They wear a badge of station that indicates their control over the various beasts. All frogs bred by the tsathar obey scourges. Tsathar scourges never become priests and thus do not have the summoning ability common tsathars can attain.</p><p>It is also rumored that tsathar scourges are created when a common tsathar consumes an implanted egg of a tsathar destined for the priest class in the hours before it hatches.<br><b>Tsathar Scourge Characters</b><br> Tsathar scourges also favor barbarian, ranger, rogue, and fighter classes.<br><b>+2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, and +2 Charisma</b>.<br><b>Darkvision:</b> Tsathar can see in the dark up to 90 feet.<br><b>Scent</b>.<br><b>Racial Hit Dice:</b> Tsathar scourges begin with four levels of monstrous humanoid, providing 4d10 Hit dice, a base attack bonus of +4, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4.<br><b>Racial Skills:</b> A tsathar scourge's monstrous humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 4 x (4 + Int modifier) for scourges.
