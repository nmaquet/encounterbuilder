This ability has been added in to the above stat block.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Wood elementals serve as protectors of the forest, and each forest usually has one, while great primeval forests may boast several. Wood elementals spend most of their time in a euphoric slumber, waking only when their forest is in danger. At these times the wood elemental moves forth to seek and destroy that which threatens the forest. At times they are known to ally with factions that work to protect and save the forest, especially elves. Wood elementals attack with a slam attack, as their limbs are strong and powerful, much like those of a treants. Huge wood elementals stand 16 to 24 feet tall, with a 3 foot to 7 foot trunk, weighing 1,500 to 4,000 pounds. Wood elementals typically replicate the look of the native trees of their forest; some wood elementals appear as mighty oaks, some as maples, birch, pine or majestic cedar trees. More exotic species are certainly possible (tiger wood, ipe, etc.).
