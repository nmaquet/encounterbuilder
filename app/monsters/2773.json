Its hair is dark and its wild, brown eyes have an almost feral-like gleam in them.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Korred</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 4</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>1,200</h5><h5>CN Small fey </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+2; <b>Senses </b>low-light vision; Perception +11</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>16, touch 14, flat-footed 13 (+2 Dex, +1 dodge, +2 natural, +1 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>27 (6d8+6)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+3, <b>Ref </b>+7, <b>Will </b>+7</h5><h5><b>DR </b>10/cold iron; <b>SR </b>15</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>slam +8 (1d2+4) or </br>shears +8 (1d4+4) or </br>club +8 (1d4+4)</h5><h5><b>Ranged </b>rock +7 (1d4+4)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>5 ft.; <b>Reach </b>5 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>animate hair, laugh, rock throwing (20 ft.)</h5><h5><b>Spell-Like Abilities</b> (CL 8th)</br>At will&mdash;<i>animate objects</i> (rock only), <i>shatter</i> (rock only, DC 13), <i>stone door</i> (functions as <i>tree stride</i>, but maximum distance moved is 30 feet), <i>stone shape</i>, <i>stone tell</i>, <i>transmute rock to mud</i> (DC 16)</h5></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>19, <b>Dex </b>15, <b>Con </b>12, <b>Int </b> 12, <b>Wis </b>14, <b>Cha </b>13</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+3; <b>CMB </b>+6; <b>CMD </b>19</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Bluff +10, Intimidate +7, Knowledge (local) +10, Knowledge (nature) +10, Perception +11, Perform (dance) +10, Stealth +15</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Common, Korred, Sylvan</h5><h5><b>Combat Gear </b>club, korred shears, pouch</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> temperate forests</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary or gang (2-4)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div></h5><h5><b>Animate Hair (Su)</b> A korred can weave its hair (contained in its pouch) into animated ropes that can entangle foes. The time it takes to weave enough hair to entangle one foe is dependent on the size of the creature as follows: <table><tr><th>Size</th><th>Time</th></tr><tr><td>Up to Tiny</td><td>1 round</td></tr><tr><td>Small or Medium</td><td>2 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>3 rounds</td></tr></table> A korred cannot entangle an opponent of greater than Large size. This ability otherwise is similar to the <i>animate rope</i> spell (caster level 15th) </h5><h5><b>Laugh (Su)</b> Three times per day, a korred can unleash a laugh that stuns all creatures that hear it within 60 feet for 1d2 rounds. A DC 14 Will save negates the effects. A bard's countersong ability allows a stunned creature a new Will save to break free. Whether the save is successful or not, a creature is immune to the laugh of the same korred for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Armed with a club that seems too large for it to wield, a korred is a satyrlike creature that dwells deep in the forest. Korreds keep their belongings in a large pouch; the contents of such a pouch vary with the tastes of the individual, but all korreds carry shears with which to cut their matted hair when it becomes too long.</p><p>A korred opens combat using its laugh to stun its opponents. It follows this with its animated hair attack. Entangled foes are pelted with rocks or attacked with shears. Korreds are automatically proficient with their shears.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Korred Shears </b>(Exotic Light Melee Weapon) Korred Shears: Cost N/A (cannot be bought); Damage 1d4 (S), 1d6 (M); Crit x3, Weight 1 lb., Type slashing.</p><p> Credit The Korred originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Korred, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d8+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 13", "Gear": "club, korred shears, pouch", "Ranged": "rock +7 (1d4+4)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2773, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 14, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Korred", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +10, Intimidate +7, Knowledge (local) +10, Knowledge (nature) +10, Perception +11, Perform (dance) +10, Stealth +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +7, Will +7", "Melee": "slam +8 (1d2+4) or shears +8 (1d4+4) or club +8 (1d4+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Small"}
