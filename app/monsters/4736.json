They literally run over (as an overrun that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) anything of size Gargantuan or smaller that is in their path, but no CMB check is necessary, and the target cannot choose to let them pass without taking any damage. The stampede deals 5d6 points of damage for every two aurochs in the herd (rounded up). Any victims of the stampede can make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Strength-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>These massive aurochs (singular and plural) are prehistoric cattle that once roamed the plains and forests of the world in vast herds but are now on the verge of extinction, being found only in the primeval forests and remote places of the Northlands where their horns are prized trophies of the hunt-though many a hunter has fallen beneath their spearlike horns and crushing hooves in the attempt. Massive beasts, these prehistoric aurochs have been used as symbols of fertility and strength for many cults down through the ages appearing in decoration from the crudest cave paintings to ornate temples. When captured they command a high price for use in the arenas of cosmopolitan regions, though they often take a heavy toll among the matadors who face them. Northlands aurochs stand 6 feet or more high at the withers with their heads rising 2 feet above that. Their characteristic lyre-shaped horns extend upward another 2 feet. They grow up to 18 feet long and can weigh as much as 8,000 pounds. Males have a black coat with a pale stripe down the spine, and females and calves have a reddish coat. A light load for a Northlands aurochs is up to 3,200 pounds; a medium load 3,201-6,400 pounds; and a heavy load 6,401-9,600 pounds. An aurochs can drag 48,000 pounds. Credit Original author Greg A.
