A creature that makes its save is immune to the horrific visage of that fachan for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. </h5><h5><b>One-Legged Stance (Ex)</b> Fachans are surprisingly nimble while hopping on their single leg. This unusual mode of movement allows the fachans to ignore the effects of difficult terrain on movement and makes it impossible to trip. </h5><h5><b>Powerful Grip (Ex)</b> A fachan can wield a two-handed weapon in its single hand, gaining all the usual benefits for wielding a two-handed weapon.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Fachans are foul-tempered and foul-smelling beasts with a taste for human flesh. Despite having only one leg and arm, they are extremely agile. Having only one eye does not hamper their vision any more than one leg hampers their mobility. Some sages believe fachans are an offshoot of one of the giant races while others believe fachans are the deformed offspring of a failed hill giant and ogre or cyclops mating. These creatures are shunned by other giant races, except hill giants with whom they have a distant but tolerable relationship. They rarely associate with other races for any reason. Fachans take up residence wherever they can find a warm, dry spot. They are not against building huts and hovels when they must, but they prefer the convenience of driving out the residents of an existing structure and claiming it as their own. They are most often encountered in wastelands and swamps. Fachan villages can consist of up to 30 individuals plus 30% noncombatant young. Fachan leaders are always fighters or barbarians. Fachans stand 12 feet tall and weigh 1,000 pounds. Their hair is unkempt and matted. Skin tone is usually bronze or brown, and their hair is dark. A fachan makes for an odd opponent at best. It most often attempts a bull rush against its largest foe in the first round of combat, and tries to avoid spellcasters. After this, it moves in with its melee attacks.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), or tribe (10-30)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+35 plus 7)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 25, Dex 9, Con 20, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4942, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Bull RushB, Iron Will, Power Attack, ToughnessB, Weapon Focus (greatclub) B", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 8, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Fachan", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Intimidate +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "one-legged stance", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +1, Will +4; +4 vs. fear effects", "Melee": "greatclub +12 (2d8+10) or slam +11 (2d6+10)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Large"}
