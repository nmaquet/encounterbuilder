At sea or on land, her steely gaze and authoritative tone ensure that her crew follow her orders quickly and without argument. An accomplished sailor herself, she has the ability to motivate her crew to work in unison and give their best effort-and indeed, to fight and die as necessary. She knows the workings of her ship inside out, often having had a hand in its construction. If the ship needs repairs in the midst of a journey, she proves herself a skilled carpenter and sail maker. If a longship is caught in one of ferocious storms that frequently lash the Steaming Sea, the captain's determination and shouted commands urging all hands to row for their lives are often the only things that prevent the ship from capsizing. Many longship captains prefer to follow coastlines, and at night have their boats seek safe harbor so that the crew can sleep in tents on the nearby shore-in such cases, the captain herself claims the privilege of the sleeping onboard, possibly with an honor guard or skeleton crew to prevent thieves or accidents. If an enemy attacks during the night, the high-walled hull of the ship can serve as an impromptu fortification. In a naval battle, a longboat captain directs both the ship's course and her crew's tactics, all while personally raining down a shower of deadly arrows on the enemy vessel. Most longboat captains are certainly capable in melee combat, but prefer to issue orders and provide support with their arrows from a vantage point from which they can observe the whole battle-often the bows of their ships. A captain's swift reactions, as well as her ability to yell a hasty word of warning or command to her crew, can d e t e r m i n e whether she and her crew face victory or defeat, life or death. When engaged in coastal raiding, the captain supervises the planning of the attack. She often leads a reserve group of raiders to strike against the strongest points of resistance or cut off those trying to flee. Those assigned to the captain's guard see the post as a mark of honor, as well as a chance for a greater share of the loot. A powerful and prosperous captain is often known to have her vessel's figurehead enchanted with the ability to spit out gouts of flame, or so that its eyes glow with an eerie light, casting fear into the hearts of enemies who see it bearing down on them.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common, Skald", "Source": "Lands Of The Linnorm Kings", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or raid (one longboat captain and 2d6 Ulfen raiders)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 8, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "+1 composite longbow +11 (1d8+5/x3)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1906, "SubType": "(human)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Deadly Aim, Iron Will, Persuasive, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Weapon Focus (composite longbow), Weapon Specialization (composite longbow)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "fighter 5", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Longboat Captain", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Craft (carpentry) +9, Intimidate +11, Profession (sailor) +7, Sense Motive +4, Swim +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "Human", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "armor training 1", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +4, Will +2; +1 vs. fear", "Melee": "mwk battleaxe +7 (1d8+1/x3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Medium"}
