Elementals receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day. Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control, obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals. Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma check to gain control of the elemental. </h5><h5><b>Searing Heat (Ex)</b> Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of Inder must succeed on a DC 37 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of fire damage. Anyone striking Inder with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 4d6 points of fire damage (DC 37 Reflex save for half). A creature that grapples Inder or is grappled by Inder takes 4d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists (DC 37 Reflex save for half). The save DCs are Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Inder rules over fire elementals and makes his home within a massive fiery lake on the Plane of Fire. He is attended by 4 elder fire elementals who serve in his court as advisors. Other fire-based creatures such as efreet, azer, and lesser fire elementals serve him in the court in minor roles. Inder also keeps a large retinue of female fire-based creatures as his harem, having over thirty wives at last count. Inder rarely engages in battle, preferring to let his fire elementals fight for him. If forced however, he opens with a <i>fireball</i>, <i>incendiary cloud</i>, and <i>fire storm</i>, before summoning creatures to his aid. When facing a large number of opponents, he often rides a red dragon of largest size into battle.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Auran, Common, Ignan, Terran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or band (Inder plus 2-4 greater fire elementals)", "Ref": "35", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(40d10+280)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 35, Dex 37, Con 24, Int 22, Wis 24, Cha 24", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4816, "SubType": "(elemental, extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Critical Focus, Dodge, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Improved Vital Strike, Iron Will, Lightning Stance, Lunge, Mobility, Power Attack, Spring Attack, Vital Strike, Weapon Finesse, Whirlwind Attack, Wind Stance", "AlternateNameForm": "Lord Of Fire Elementals", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "31", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "34, touch 22, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Inder", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +56, Climb +52, Diplomacy +47, Escape Artist +53, Intimidate +50, Knowledge (arcana) +49, Knowledge (planes) +49, Knowledge (religion) +49, Perception +50, Sense Motive +50, Stealth +48, Survival +47", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "22", "Race": "", "CR": "23", "XP": 820000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Fire)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +31, Ref +35, Will +22", "Melee": "2 slams +51 (4d6+12 plus burn)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "60 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
