A frost man can remove its eye patch as a free action. A creature in the area takes 3d6 points of cold damage (DC 13 Reflex for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Frost men are hunters that make their home in the cold regions of the world. Each carries his personal belongings in small sacks and takes them wherever he goes. A frost man's body radiates cold out to 30 feet, though not enough to deal damage.</p><p>There is much speculation on the society of frost men. Other beings only encounter them as lone males. Speculation suggests that there must be villages somewhere with women and children, perhaps buried deep in cold mountain caves. Tribes that are aware of frost men fear them greatly for their deadly talent and refer to them as \"ice demons.\" Frost men appear in the outside world occasionally and wish only to go about their unknown business undisturbed. Anyone bothering them can expect to be attacked. A frost man usually opens combat with its ice blast before moving in to kill off anything not subsequently frozen to death.</p><p><br></br><b>Frost Man Characters</b><br></br> Most frost man leaders are fighters or fighter/rogues.
