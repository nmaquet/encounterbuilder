They build their nests at the top of broadleaved trees or high atop rocky outcroppings in less forested terrain. A corpse rook's nest is constructed from mud, grass, hair, leaves, and the bones of their victims. These creatures do not associate with other avian creatures and are often hunted by red dragons, green dragons, rocs, and wyverns (who savor the taste of their flesh).</p><p>Corpse rooks are solitary hunters with a hunting territory often covering 5 miles in each direction away from its nest. Hunting is always done during the day when the corpse rook has the advantage. During mating season (spring and early summer months) both the male and female corpse rook hunt for food, sometimes together, but most often in separate directions away from the nest. A nest typically contains 1d4 silver and gold-flecked eggs as well as treasure from slain prey.</p><p>Corpse rooks attack their foes from the air, slashing with their claws and biting with their sharpened beaks. They rarely land on the ground during battle, preferring to swoop in and out of melee to keep their opponents off balance. Multiple corpse rooks work together to bring down prey; one might land on the ground to draw the attention of the prey, while the other corpse rook swoops in behind to flank. Creatures killed by a corpse rook are carried back to the nest and either devoured or fed to the newborns.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or nest (pair plus 1d4 young)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2400, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Weapon Focus (bite), Wingover", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 12, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Corpse Rook", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +5, Perception +15, Search +5, Stealth +2", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate or warm plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +8, Will +3", "Melee": "3 bites +11 (1d8+5), 2 claws +10 (1d6+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., fly 80 ft.
