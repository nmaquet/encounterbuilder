As a standard action, a chief vegepygmy can release a cloud of spores in a 40-foot spread. A living creature caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. After the paralysis wears off, the character must succeed on another DC 17 Fortitude save or take 3d6 points of Constitution damage. This save DC is Constitution-based. At Constitution 0 a creature dies, and rises as a 4 HD vegepygmy bodyguard in one day. If a <i>remove disease</i> spell is cast on a paralyzed victim before the paralysis wears off, he does not have to attempt the second Fortitude save and takes no Constitution damage.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>When a living creature is slain by russet mold (see that entry), it rises as a vegepygmy commoner. Vegepygmies are low-intelligence plants that make their home deep in the forests or underground away from most settled areas. They are hunters and scavengers, and carnivorous, preying on living creatures weaker than themselves.</p><p>A vegepygmy ranges from two feet to four and a half feet tall. Though they do not seem to have ears, it is well known that vegepygmies can hear.</p><p>Vegepygmies do not speak, but communicate with others of their kind by thumping their chest or rapping their spears on rocks, earth, or some other solid surface. It is not known if or how they communicate with other creatures.</p><p>Vegepygmies attack with claws or weapons, usually either a longspear or club. They prefer to ambush opponents, using their coloration to blend with their natural surroundings.</p><p>Credit The Vegepygmy originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1980) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "band (1 plus 1 subchief, 2-8 bodyguards, 4-7 guards, 6-10 workers) or tribe (30-300 commoners plus 2-8 guards, 2-8 bodyguards, 1 subchief per 50 commoners, 1 chief per 100 commoners, 10-24 thornies, 1-4 patches of russet mold, 1-3 shriekers)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d8+36)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 16", "Gear": "masterwork spear", "Ranged": "mwk spear +9 (1d8+5/x3)", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3416, "SubType": "(fungus)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness, Weapon Focus (spear)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth (+12 in forested or swampy areas)", "AC": "17, touch 11, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Vegepygmy Chief", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Diplomacy +4, Intimidate +8, Perception +17, Stealth +17 (+25 in forested or swampy areas), Survival +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +4, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +11 (1d6+5) or mwk spear +13/+8 (1d8+7/x3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
