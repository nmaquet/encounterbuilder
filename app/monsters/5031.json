It cannot make a slam attack during the round in which it engulfs. The algant merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-in a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to an automatic slam attack each round, gain the pinned condition, are in danger of drowning, and are trapped within the algant's body until they are no longer pinned. The save DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Animate Plants (Sp)</b> A plant guardian can animate any plants of the same type within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two such plants at a time. It takes 1 full round for the plant to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a plant of the same type as the one animating it (exceptions are noted in each entry below), gaining the plant guardian's vulnerability to fire. If the plant guardian that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the plant immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state. </h5><h5><b>Double Damage against Objects (Ex)</b> A plant guardian or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. </h5><h5><b>Plantspeech (Ex)</b> A plant guardian has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual <i>speak with plants</i> spell, and most plants greet them with an attitude of friendly or helpful.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The algants are the plant guardians of the water.
