The target can attempt to burst these entangling vines before the duration expires with a DC 12 Strength check as a full-round action. The save and burst DCs are Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Keepsake (Su)</b> Gourd leshys can pop off the top of their heads and store a single Fine-sized object such as a dagger or potion inside While within the leshy's head, the item is warded by <i>nondetection</i>. In addition, after 24 hours, the item within is cleaned and polished, and, if damaged, repaired as if by a <i>mending</i> spell. Both spell effects have a caster level equal to twice the leshy's Hit Dice (CL 2nd for most gourd leshys). </h5><h5><b>Seed (Ex)</b> A gourd leshy can hurl its seeds as a ranged attack. If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified by Strength) and affects the target with the gourd leshy's ensnare ability. This attack has a 10-foot range increment.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>With tangles of leafy vines for limbs and a carved gourd for a head, gourd leshys present a rather comical appearance. Intimately connected with the harvest season, gourd leshys see to the health and sustainable harvest of crops, especially vegetables and grains. Superstition and love of rituals run deep in gourd leshys. They do their best to exactly reproduce what worked before with every trivial activity, and change seemingly random details when attempting tasks they previously failed. Gourd leshys collect random odds and ends as good luck charms, ranging from polished stones to bird feathers to tarnished coins. Credulous to a fault, gourd leshys believe nearly anything they hear from those they trust. However, their admittedly hollow heads still hold memories, and a gourd leshy betrayed rarely forgets. As gourd leshys aren't particularly strong, they often fight dirty. One favorite trick is to wait for an enemy to come within striking distance while in gourd form so that they can assume their true form and make a sneak attack in the same round. <br><b>GROWING A GOURD LESHY</b><br> Gourd leshys grow best in small vegetable patches or in sunny meadows. Carving eyes and a mouth into a growing gourd leshy's \"face\" is an important part of the growth ritual, for neglecting to do this robs the gourd leshy of its ability to see or speak. The exact nature and appearance of a gourd leshy's features can vary wildly between individuals. <br><b>GOURD LESHY</b> </h5><h5><b>CL </b>6th; </h5><h5><b>Price </b>1,500 gp </h5><h5><b>RITUAL </b> </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, <i>entangle</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>summon nature's ally I</i>; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Knowledge (nature) DC 13; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>750 gp</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Druidic, Sylvan; plantspeech (gourds)", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 3", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or patch (2-16)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d8+5)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 6, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "seed +3 (1 plus ensnare)", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2122, "SubType": "(leshy, shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth and Survival in plains and undergrowth", "AC": "13, touch 13, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gourd Leshy", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +4, Stealth +6 (+10 in plains and undergrowth), Survival +0 (+4 in plains and undergrowth)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any hills or plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "change shape (Small gourd; tree shape), keepsake, verdant burst", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +2, Will +0", "Melee": "slam -1 (1d3-2 plus ensnare)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
