All living creatures within 5 ft. must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is a poison effect, and once a creature successfully saves it is immune to the spore cloud of that particular fungus man for 24 hours.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Fungus men are an extremely peaceful and easy-going race of intelligent plants. They are bipedal, in a squat, humanoid fashion. The fungus men are sexless, and reproduce by means of spore clouds. They lack the appendages for fine manipulation of objects, but are quite dexterous in their own way. The fungus men are fiercely loyal to their fungus man king, and attack immediately if it is threatened. Fungus men do not communicate by verbal means; they have learned to deal with outsiders by using hand gestures and supplicating movements. They communicate with each other by pheromones and spores release. Fungus men cohabitate in enclaves throughout the underdark, farming lichen and mosses to trade with other races for soil and excrement (their sources of food). Some fungus man colonies keep \"domesticated\" giant lizards available to replenish their dung fields and for pack animal uses. Fungus man colonies are not hostile towards each other; neither do they work together in any societal fashion.
