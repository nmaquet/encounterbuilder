Much as a dryad is bonded with one tree and is devoted to it, a hamadryad loves her chosen forest; while she does not sicken and die if separated from it, she loathes such separation. All nonevil woodland creatures acknowledge her as the wisest of dryads and respect her gifts of healing and diplomacy. In most forests, a hamadryad is the sister or wife of an erlking, and represents the protective, patient, and nurturing aspect of nature. With her healing magic, she can relieve the suffering of a dryad whose tree has been killed and sustain her long enough for her to bond with another tree. A hamadryad prefers to avoid direct confrontations, instead using her magic and allies to divert, confuse, and even befriend any would-be enemies. Her powers allow her to speak with or quickly travel to her subjects even when they are in the most remote parts of the forest. As a consequence, little happens in the forest without her knowledge, and those who enter her realm would do well to remember this.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Elven, Sylvan; speak with animals, speak with plants, tongues", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "retinue (1 plus 2-5 dryads) or court (1 plus 2-12 centaurs, 2-12 dryads, 2-8 satyrs, and 1-2 treants)", "Ref": "18", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(20d6+120)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 23, Con 23, Int 18, Wis 19, Cha 22", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "+2 speed composite longbow +18/+18/+13 (1d8+7/x3)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5258, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Combat Casting, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Improved Iron Will, Iron Will, Mounted Combat, Stealthy, Toughness, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Craft (wood)", "AC": "29, touch 17, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Hamadryad", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +29, Climb +14, Craft (wood) +12, Diplomacy +29, Escape Artist +19, Handle Animal +16, Heal +9, Intimidate +16, Knowledge (geography) +17, Knowledge (nature) +27, Knowledge (nobility) +9, Perception +31, Perform (any one) +19, Ride +16, Sense Motive +19, Spellcraft +14, Stealth +19, Survival +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "18", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "druid magic, tree meld, wild empathy, woodcraft", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +18, Will +18", "Melee": "mwk dagger +16/+11 (1d4+5/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CG", "Size": "Medium"}
