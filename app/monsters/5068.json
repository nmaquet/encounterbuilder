Most of their time is spent inside their tube-like lair where they simply wait for prey to pass by. Once prey is detected, they rush to the attack, quickly poisoning their target, and dragging it back into their lair. Giant funnel-web lairs are large spiraling tubes with open funnel-like mouths, typically built under large rocks, fallen trees, or straight into the ground. The entirely of the tube is covered with thick spider webs. Trip lines radiate outward from the mouth of the lair, up to 100 feet away. These trip lines signal to the spider that prey is near. Female funnel-web spiders are generally larger than males, with shorter legs and thicker abdomens. Females lay several egg sacs a few times each year which quickly hatch. The young rapidly develop and reach maturity within 2 years generally, and leave the lair to go out on their own. Giant funnel-web spiders can live up to 20 years. A giant funnel-web spider is highly aggressive. If threatened or provoked, unlike other spiders, it rears on its back legs and displays its fangs. This warning position signifies the spider is about to strike. When a funnel-web attacks, its grabs its prey and repeatedly injects it with its deadly poison.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or burrow (2-5)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(8d8+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 25, Dex 17, Con 18, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5068, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "LungeB, Virulent PoisonB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Climb, +4 Perception, +4 Stealth (+8 in webs)", "AC": "16, touch 12, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Giant Funnel-Web Spider", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +23, Perception +4, Stealth +3 (+7 in webs)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any temperate and warm", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "hold breath", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +5, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +12 (2d6+14 plus grab and poison)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., burrow 10 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
