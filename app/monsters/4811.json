Often they have lairs hidden deep beneath snow and ice packs burrowed deep into the living stone where they plunder for gemstones and metals as any other dwarf. Skilled crafters, frost dwarves trade freely with frost giants, constructing many of their massive weapons and armor in exchange for loot and protection. They are typically disliked and dismissed by their \"true\" dwarven kin who consider them to be abominations or worse. Frost dwarves are known for their rudeness and coarse sense of humor. They are however famed for their skill at craftsmanship and the enchantment of strange and unusual magical items. Most typically frost dwarves are worshippers of Thrym and enjoy his taste in puzzles and conundrums. Frost dwarf traps are legendary amongst the frozen wastes of the world. Frost dwarves are proficient combatants and make use of their natural surroundings to their advantage. They assault enemies with crossbows from distance and use their battleaxe to crush charges. They enjoy surprise and prefer to attack using dirty tricks such as unleashing avalanches upon unsuspecting travelers, then pick through their frozen carcasses for loot. Higher level frost dwarves often ride winter wolves as mounts. It is not uncommon for 1-2 of the beasts to be in the company of a frost dwarf squad. <br><b>Frost Dwarf Society</b><br> Frost dwarves are commonly found serving frost giant masters. In their own nations they elect a king from the ruling clans. This jarl rules for life though does not necessarily establish any form of dynasty. Frost dwarf clans organize themselves loosely after the fashion of their mountain and hill dwarf cousins, but are more tribal in nature. Frost dwarves keep a semblance of military titles amongst the various clans. Frost dwarves are attuned to the use of magic and many of their leaders are powerful wizards or clerics. They are equally likely to be barbarians. There are no frost dwarf females. Frost dwarves are born to the union of a frost dwarf and dwarf (any), human, gnome, or frost or hill giant. Any child conceived from such a union is always born a frost dwarf male and reaches full size within a matter of weeks. Frost dwarf children are often abandoned near known frost dwarf communities where it is expected they will be found and cared for or claimed by their father's clan. Frost dwarves are often shunned by their maternal parent as an abomination, especially among hill and mountain dwarves who likely banish the mother from their halls if she survives the child's birth. The exception to this rule is that of frost dwarves born to frost giant and jotun mothers. In frost giant culture, frost dwarves are considered a sign of good luck. They are however still sent to live amongst others of their kind until they reach the age of maturity, which is about 50 years old, when they are welcomed back amongst the frost giants who sired them.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Dwarf, Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "Team (2-4), squad (9-16 plus 3 3rd-level sergeants and 1 leader of 3rd-8th level, or clan (30-100 plus 30% non-combatants plus 1 3rd level sergeant per 10 adults, 5 5th-level lieutenants, and 3 7th level captains, or jarldom (2-6 clans plus one jarl or king of level 10+)", "Ref": "0", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4811, "SubType": "(cold, dwarf)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Focus (battleaxe)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth in snow", "AC": "13, touch 10, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Frost Dwarf", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Craft (any) +5, Perception +1, Stealth +0 (+4 in snow), Survival +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "dwarf traits", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +0, Will +1", "Melee": "battleaxe +3 (1d8+1 plus 1d4 cold)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Medium"}
