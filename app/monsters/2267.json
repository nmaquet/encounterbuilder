This attack has a range of 40 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only 30 such darts in one day. </h5><h5><b>Implant (Ex)</b> A creature hit by one of the blood bush's flower darts is implanted with one of its seeds. A seed quickly germinates as follows: <table><tr><th>Round</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>First</td><td>DC 18 Will save or flee in fear for 1d6 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>Third</td><td>Paralysis for 1d4+2 rounds; DC 18 Fortitude negates</td></tr><tr><td>Fifth</td><td>Wounding: 1 point of Constitution damage per minute until the seed is removed or destroyed.</td></tr></table> A seed can be removed safely up to 5 rounds after implantation with a successful DC 18 Heal check or by cutting it from the victim (dealing 1d2 points of damage); otherwise only a <i>remove disease</i> spell destroys an implanted seed. The save DCs and check DC are Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Sonic Vulnerability (Ex)</b> A blood bush that is subjected to a sonic-based attack or effect (such as a <i>shout</i> spell) loses its blindsight ability and is effectively blinded (as the <i>blindness</i> spell) for a 1d4+6 rounds.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The blood bush is a fell plant creature cursed by a wizard in times past. It is named for its blood-red flowers and its thorny blood-red seeds. A blood bush is sometimes referred to as a \"grave marker plant\" because a creature that encounters it, and fails to see the danger this sinister plant presents, rarely lives to tell about it.</p><p>A blood bush can only be grown from a seed that has germinated inside the warm body of a Small or larger animal. Roots from the germinating seed kill the host and use the nutrients provided to grow rapidly into a deadly plant. A number of nobles use this horrid plant as a deterrent against thieves and robbers, sometimes creating entire hedges of these plants.</p><p>A blood bush appears as a flowering bush about 3 feet tall. Its thick trunk quickly splits off into many smaller, whip-like branches, each topped with a blood-red flower surrounded by deep green leaves. Blood bush seeds can be sold for about 20 gp each on the open market; collecting them and living to earn the money they bring is not the easiest of tasks.</p><p>When a blood bush detects a warm-blooded creature within 20 feet, it fires a volley of flower darts at the creature, attempting to implant it with its seeds. A creature that dies from the blood bush's seed implantation rapidly decomposes, and a new blood bush springs up in the area within four days.</p><p>Living creatures within 5 feet of a blood bush are slashed and cut with its four whip-like tendrils.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Lance Hawvermale.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, cluster (2-4)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d8+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 10, Con 20, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "flower dart +5 (1d2+2)", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2267, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 11, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Blood Bush", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +2, Will +3", "Melee": "tendril +7 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "0 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
