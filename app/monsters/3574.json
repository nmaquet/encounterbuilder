This functions like <i>disguise self</i>, but with no restrictions on duration, creature type, or size. The mockingfey does not change size, and if the creature it's mimicking is larger than it, the mockingfey simply appears to be a miniature version. Anyone interacting with this effect can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the ruse. A mockingfey can maintain a given form indefinitely, but cannot change to any form other than its own without visual reference-once a given disguise has ended, the fey must see the subject again to resume that form. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Mockingfey originally stem from the First World, where they're regarded as entertainment by locals and nuisances by visitors, who are the usual butt of the creatures' pranks. The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies called japes or mockingdells, inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler's shoulder or some nearby vantage. It then promptly shifts shape to become a perfect, miniature doppelganger of the creature in question, proceeding to cavort and imitate the newcomer in a most convincing and unf lattering manner, mimicking the creature's tone but chattering only gibberish. This gibberish is not solely for comic effect, as while mockingfey are eager (if distractible) students in most matters, they refuse to use verbal language of any sort, believing that words unnecessarily constrain the things they describe. Instead, they communicate through gestures, pantomime, and elaborate dances. Those who think them mere beasts, however, are quickly set straight, as enemies of mockingfey are confronted with disorienting magic and the mockingfey's capricious allies from the First World. While many people find mockingfeys' antics irritating, the little creatures are surprisingly useful allies, with a loyal, friendly nature toward those who treat them well, and an insatiable curiosity that makes them surprisingly well informed about their surroundings. This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as the portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and the First World. When such planar rifts occur, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures through, with colonies found in Kyonin, the River Kingdoms, and sylvan groves around the Inner Sea. Those illusionists and other spellcasters who seek such puckish familiars (and take the Improved Familiar feat) often find them worth the resulting hassle-if just barely. A typical mockingfey is 8 inches tall and weighs 2 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Inner Sea Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or jape (3-20)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d6+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 6, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3574, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 15, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mockingfey", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +9, Disguise +7, Fly +15, Perception +7, Stealth +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any forests (First World)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "mock", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +6, Will +4", "Melee": "2 talons +6 (1d2-2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., fly 60 ft.
