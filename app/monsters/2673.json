An attached gryph is effectively grappling its prey. The gryph loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 11, but holds on with great tenacity and gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls with its bite. Alternatively, an attached gryph can attempt to implant eggs in the target. An attached gryph has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached gryph can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the gryph is removed. </h5><h5><b>Implant Eggs (Ex)</b> Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target that it is currently attached to as a full-round action by extending an ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrating the victim's flesh by making a successful +4 melee attack. On a hit, the ovipositor inflicts 1 damage and implants 1d4 eggs into the victim's body. As long as a victim has gryph eggs implanted in his body, he is sickened as the eggs draw nutrients from his blood and flesh. The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous baby gryphs that immediately burrow out of the victim's body. This inflicts 2 points of Constitution damage per baby gryph, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away. Treat a gryph hatchling as a bat if statistics are needed. Gryph eggs can be cut out of a victim's body with a successful DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action that inflicts 1 point of damage per attempt. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against gryph egg implantation, <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> immediately destroys any implanted gryph eggs.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Gryphs are bird-like creatures found in dungeons, ruins, and caverns.</p><p>They are typically scavengers, feeding on dead rodents and other small animals, but in times when food is scarce they take on a more predatory role and become hunters, craving the flesh and blood of warm-blooded creatures.</p><p>A gryph has four, six, or eight legs. Its feathers are jet black, as are its talons and beak, and its eyes are reddish-brown in color. The gryph has a long, needle-like beak that it uses with deadly accuracy.</p><p>A gryph attacks by swooping down at its prey at high speed and stabbing with its beak. If a female gryph is present, she attempts to grapple an opponent and implant her eggs in the prey.</p><p>Credit The Gryph originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Peter Brown.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "flock (2-7 plus 1 female per 3 gryphs) or throng (8-15 plus 1 female per 3 gryphs)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d10+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 11, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2673, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "13, touch 13, flat-footed 11", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gryph", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +8, Perception +5, Stealth +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +1", "Melee": "bite +5 (1d6/x3), legs +5 (attach)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 50 ft.
