If the target is reduced to 0 Dexterity, it is instantly turned to jade-colored stone. Inanimate corpses targeted by this attack are instantly turned to stone, but benefit from the perpetual effects of gentle repose while petrified. The spell stone to flesh reverses this effect. Poison-inhaled; save DC 14; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dexterity damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5><h5><b> Inanimate (Ex)</b> An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise. Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves. </h5><h5><b>Share Abilities (Su)</b> An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*). </h5><h5><b>Skills</b> In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies. </h5><h5><b>Tainted Air (Su)</b> All creatures within 30 feet of a jade idol take a -2 penalty on saving throws against poison. The effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the jade idol's aura. </h5><h5><b>Venom Affinity (Su)</b> Any poisonous animal or vermin that comes within 10 feet of a jade idol or a creature bearing the idol must make a DC 14 Will save or be charmed as per the spell charm animal. Beasts affected by this effect remain charmed for 10 minutes, obeying either the idol's will or its bearer's. Any creature that makes its save cannot be affected by the same jade idol's venom affinity for the next 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>From the moldering depths of the Sodden Lands to far away Tian Xia, jade idols stand watch over sacred temples, royal tombs, the monuments of powerful ancients, and the hidden lairs of plotting assassins and cruel wizards.</p><p>Crafted primarily to serve as unassuming killers, jade idols possess unnatural patience, waiting for weeks, months, or even years for the opportune time when they might be delivered into their victims' hands and forgotten before striking. Jade idols are also particularly valued for their ability to transform living flesh into a stone similar in appearance to jade, but far more brittle and ultimately worthless (a DC 14 Appraise or Knowledge [nature] check reveals the difference). Regardless of the stone's value, the tombs of many forgotten dynasties bear small legions of jade idols, left by their departed masters to keep the residents preserved in lifeless jade for all time.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "understands creator's language (cannot speak)", "Source": "AP 27", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 4, Dex 17, Con -, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "sliver +10 (1d2-3)", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 404, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth amid jade objects", "AC": "20, touch 17, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Jade Idol", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +5, Stealth +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "inanimate, share abilities", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "2 slams +5 (1d2-3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Diminutive"}
