Creatures attacking a daraka unarmed or with natural weapons are automatically stung for 1d6 points of damage and suffer the effects of the scorpion's poison (see Poison, above). Alternately, a daraka can sling scorpions from its body to a range of 20 feet. This is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature hit takes 1d6 points of damage from the stinging scorpions and is subjected to their poison. A grappled creature is likewise subjected to the stinging of a daraka's scorpions just as if it had attacked the daraka unarmed (see above). A daraka has an unlimited supply of scorpions. As fast as it uses them, its body generates more.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Darakas act as guards to the greater demons or as shock troops in the demonic armies of the Abyss. Being intelligent, they are often used as commanders or leaders, with each daraka having a battalion of minor demons at its command.</p><p>A daraka's skin is leathery and oily. From a distance greater than 10 feet, its body appears to be a mass of writhing flesh. Closer inspection reveals thousands of tiny scorpions swarming its flesh. They constantly skitter across the daraka's body-into and out of its mouth, ears, and nose. The daraka doesn't even seem to notice them.</p><p>Darakas stand 9 feet tall and weigh 700 pounds.</p><p>Darakas aggressively assault any creature that stands in their way. They usually open combat by slinging scorpions at their opponents and using <i>chaos hammer</i> against lawful-aligned opponents. Against an enemy wizard, a daraka uses <i>feeblemind</i> as soon as it can. The remainder of the combat sees the daraka slash with its claws and bite with its terrible fangs.</p><p>If it can, a daraka likes to grapple a foe and let the scorpions on its body bite the grabbed opponent.</p><p>A daraka's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+96)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 11, Con 27, Int 18, Wis 18, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "scorpions +11 (1d6 plus poison)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2439, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Great Cleave, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claws)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "27, touch 9, flat-footed 27", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Daraka Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +20, Climb +24, Intimidate +20, Knowledge (arcana) +19, Knowledge (Planes) +19, Perception +31, Sense Motive +23, Spellcraft +16, Stealth +11, Survival +19", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "12", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +8, Will +12", "Melee": "2 claws +21 (1d8+9 plus grab), bite +20 (2d6+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
