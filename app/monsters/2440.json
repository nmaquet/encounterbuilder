It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name. </h5><h5><b>Plane Shift (Su)</b> A gallu-demon can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Abyss. This ability transports the gallu-demon and one grappled victim (who gets no save to avoid the shift). It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Gallu-demons are shape-shifting demons of the underworld. They are often employed as soldiers and spies by various demon lords and balors in their abyssal armies. Gallu-demons are quick to anger and hard to control, so companies of these demonic beings are loosely organized at best.</p><p>Where the gallu-demon excels however, is entering the material planes, disguising itself as a normal humanoid, and abducting a mortal it has befriended, quickly whisking it back to its abyssal lair where it turns said mortal over to its master. Gallu-demons have been known to spend months at a time on the Material Plane just to befriend and eventually abduct a chosen target. Abducted targets are sometimes devoured by a gallu-demon before it has completed its task, but more often than not, an abducted victim is given to the gallu-demon's master who enslaves the victim (or sometimes devours it himself).</p><p>A gallu-demon stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Its flesh is glossy black and other than a large mouth lined with teeth, it has no facial features, though it does seem to be able to see, hear, and smell normally.</p><p>Gallu-demons attempt to snatch opponents and transport them to the nether spheres of the underworld, where other demons and undead lie waiting in ambush, eager to consume such hapless victims. The galludemon often uses its shape-altering power to approach unsuspecting victims, or to perform special missions such as escorting mortals out of the underworld to claim another in their stead. It must reveal its true form to employ its improved grab ability.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or squad (4-12)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+28)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 11, Con 18, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2440, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 9, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Gallu-Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +13, Diplomacy +13, Disguise +13, Intimidate +13, Perception +12, Sense Motive +12, Stealth +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "alter shape, dimension door, plane shift", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +7, Will +4", "Melee": "2 claws +12 (1d6+6 plus grab), bite +12 (1d8+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
