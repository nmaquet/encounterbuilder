The hindquarters of the animal are that of a great fish. Its body is covered in fine scales in the fore parts and large scales elsewhere. The hippocampus' scales vary in color from ivory to deep green, with shades of blue and silver. Aquatic races often tame these animals, and they make fine steeds, for they are strong, swift, and very intelligent. A hippocampus is about 8 feet long and weighs about 600 pounds. Hippocampuses speak Aquan. Some speak common.</p><p>Hippocampuses are docile creatures and only fight if threatened or if an ally is threatened. In combat, they use their powerful bite or tail slap. On rare occasions, the hippocampus may butt an opponent with its head.<br><b>Training a Hippocampus</b><br> A hippocampus requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.</p><p>To be trained, a hippocampus must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check).</p><p>Training a friendly hippocampus requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a hippocampus requires an exotic saddle.</p><p>A hippocampus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p><p>Hippocampus eggs are worth 1,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 2,500 gp each. Professional trainers (usually tritons) charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a hippocampus.</p><p>Carrying Capacity: A light load for a hippocampus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds Credit The Hippocampus originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Erica Balsley, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair or herd (3-8)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2684, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Endurance, Skill Focus (perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth underwater", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Hippocampus", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +7, Stealth +7 (+11 underwater), Swim +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +6, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +7 (1d4+4) or tail slap +7 (1d6+4) or butt +7 (1d3+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "Swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "CG", "Size": "Large"}
