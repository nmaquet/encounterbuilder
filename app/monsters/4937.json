It cannot make any other attack in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that are not adjacent to them. Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Gaseous (Ex)</b> A smoke elemental can pass through small holes or narrow openings without reducing its speed. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Wind (Ex)</b> A smoke elemental is treated as two sizes smaller for purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Smoke elementals are creatures of elemental smoke: part fire, part air. Where the Elemental Plane of Air meets the Elemental Plane of Fire lies a para-elemental plane, that of Elemental Smoke. It is from that black clouded region that these creatures hail. Smoke elementals spend most of their time on their home plane, only occasionally venturing into the Elemental Planes of Air or Fire. Rarely do they ever enter the Material Plane unless called by a spellcaster. A smoke elemental appears as a cloud of black smoke or thick fog. No discernible features can be seen in its form, though it can reshape itself at will to form two large eyes and a mouth of empty darkness (which serve no purpose other than to perhaps startle onlookers).</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-8)", "Ref": "15", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 27, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4937, "SubType": "(air, elemental, extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in smoke or fog", "AC": "22, touch 17, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Huge Smoke Elemental", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Escape Artist +21, Fly +25, Perception +13, Stealth +13 (+21 in smoke or fog)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Air, Plane of Fire, or Plane of Smoke)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "gaseous", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +15, Will +3", "Melee": "2 slams +16 (2d6+5 plus burn)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 80 ft.
