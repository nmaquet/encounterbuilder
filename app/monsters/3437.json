This range increases to 120 feet if the opponents are upwind; and decreases to 30 feet if downwind. By making a successful DC 15 Wisdom check the abyssal wolf can determine whether a tiefling or half-fiend is present among the opponents. </h5><h5><b>Know Alignment (Su)</b> Abyssal wolves always know the alignment of any creature they look upon. This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the abyssal wolf can activate it again as a free action on its next turn. </h5><h5><b>Paralyzing Gaze (Su)</b> Anyone within 40 feet meeting the gaze of an abyssal wolf must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. Half-fiends and tieflings have a -2 circumstance penalty on this save. Once a successful save is made, the target is immune to the effects of that abyssal wolf's gaze attack for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Abyssal wolves roam the Abyss seeking sources of meat. They savor the flesh and blood of lesser demons and have a particular liking for the taste of tieflings and good-aligned outsiders. Should a pack of abyssal wolves run across one of the aforementioned creatures, it does not hesitate to attack. The blood and flesh of half-fiends is another meal that these monsters enjoy, so they rarely turn down an opportunity to hunt on the Material Plane. Many demon lords find it blasphemous that their own kind mate with mortals, and thus unleash these monsters on the Material Plane to deal with such creatures. Most often when encountered on the Material Plane, abyssal wolves have either been summoned by an evil spellcaster or unleashed by one of the demonic lords of the Abyss.</p><p>The abyssal wolf is a man-sized wolf that stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder. When enraged, the hair on the nape of its neck stands up and the wolf issues forth a low growl, bearing its razor-sharp (and usually blood-stained) teeth.</p><p>Abyssal wolves hunt in packs. When prey is sighted, the monsters move within range where they can use their paralyzing gaze. Foes that are not paralyzed are dealt with first; the wolves circle an opponent and take turns charging in and attacking. A foe that is tripped is pounced on by the pack. Once the pack deals with the immediate threat, they turn their attention to any paralyzed creatures and tear them to pieces.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (4-11)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+42)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 17, Con 20, Int 8, Wis 14, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3437, "SubType": "(chaotic, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception and Sense Motive vs. half-fiends and tieflings", "AC": "20, touch 12, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Abyssal Wolf", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +9 (+11 vs. half-fiends and tieflings), Sense Motive +2 (+4 vs. half-fiends and tieflings), Stealth +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "The Abyss", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +8, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +11 (1d8+7 plus trip)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
