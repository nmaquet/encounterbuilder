Any living creature within this area takes 1 point of damage per round until it leaves the area. Undead in the area heal 1 hit point each round they remain in the area. Undead cannot more hit points than their normal total from the netherspark's aura. </h5><h5><b>Negative Energy Burst (Su)</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, a netherspark can release a burst of negative energy in a 20-foot radius around it. Creatures in the area take 1d8+10 points of negative energy damage. Undead take no damage but heal a number of hit points equal to what the ray would otherwise deal. </h5><h5><b>Negative Energy Ray (Su)</b> Once per round as a standard action, a netherspark can release a ray of negative energy with a rangte of 40 feet as a ranged touch attack. A target hit takes gains one negative level if it fails a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw. On a successful save, the target avoids the negative level but still takes 1d8 points of negative energy damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Nethersparks are natives of the negative energy plane that sometimes find themselves lost in the material plane where they seek to transform positive energy into a negative charge. On their home plane, they are attracted to living organisms, and seek to transform them into nothingness where both they and their home plane absorb the creature's positive essence. On the material planes these creatures are often found haunting graveyards or in the employ of a powerful necromancer. Undead creatures are attracted to, and can detect the presence of a netherspark within 60 feet.</p><p>A netherspark stands about 6 feet tall and weighs about 180 pounds. Its body is entirely composed of negative energy and dark matter. No facial features are discernable on its head, though the creature can see, hear, and speak.</p><p>A netherspark begins combat using its negative energy ray before closing into melee range. In close combat, the creature rains blow after blow down on its adversaries with its powerful fists. The creature continually moves around during combat attempting to expose as many targets as possible to its negative energy aura. A netherspark's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>A netherspark's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Common, Draconic, and Infernal", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d10+70)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 16, Con 24, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "negative energy ray +13 touch (1 level, DC 22)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2846, "SubType": "(evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (ray)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 13, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Netherspark", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +16, Bluff +15, Climb +14, Diplomacy +15, Intimidate +15, Knowledge (planes) +15, Linguistics +3, Perception +20, Survival +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Negative Energy Plane", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +10, Will +10", "Melee": "2 slam +14 (1d6+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
