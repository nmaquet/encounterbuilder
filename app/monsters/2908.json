These creatures spend their days swimming beneath the burning surface of the Sea of Fire, searching for prey. Their diet consists of other aquatic creatures found in the Sea of Fire such as fire crabs, oil worms, and the great fire whales. The latter is a particular favorite of the oil shark, and while the typical great fire whale outweighs (and is generally larger) than the typical oil shark, an oil shark pack has been known to attack and kill with ease a lone fire whale. Oil sharks have never been encountered outside the Plane of Molten Skies or Plane of Fire though sages believe the oil shark can exist in normal water.</p><p>Oil sharks are completely blind and rely completely upon their \"sonar\" to hunt their prey. Oil sharks generally behave as other sharks; circling their prey before striking with their powerful jaws. Non-aquatic prey (i.e., creatures that breathe air) are often grasped in its jaws and dragged below the surface of the burning sea where it drowns in the oily waters. Their oily hides allow them to glide smoothly and quickly through normal water.</p><p>Oil sharks are a delicacy of volcano giants and are often hunted by such creatures. The thick, metallic hide of an oil shark is prized by salamanders and they often hunt these creatures, kill them, and sculpt armor from the hide. Oil shark armor is detailed in the sidebar.<br><b>Oil Shark Armor (Medium Armor)</b><br> Because of the natural oily nature of the metal in an oil shark's scales (which retain these properties even after its death), a creature suffers no penalty to Swim checks for wearing this armor and also adds a +5 bonus to all Escape Artist checks. In addition, a creature wearing oil shark armor is unaffected by obstructions such as webs (magical or otherwise).<br><b>Oil Shark Armor:</b> Cost 1,000 gp (usually can't be bought); Armor Bonus +6; Maximum Dex Bonus +2; Armor Check Penalty -4; Arcane Spell Failure 30%; Speed 20 ft. (Base 30 ft.), 15 ft.
