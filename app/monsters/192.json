If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes. The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that require line of sight or line of effect. A giant flytrap that is grappling or pinning a foe cannot attack other targets with that bite, but is not otherwise hindered.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p>A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but abundant animal life, this dangerous predator is an immense version of its more common (and much smaller) kin. Whereas the smaller flytraps supplement their growth by catching insects, the giant flytrap does the same with animals, humanoids, and anything else foolish enough to draw too near. Local legends call this plant names like \"mancatcher,\" \"snapperjaw plant,\" \"dragonleaf plant,\" \"cowbiter,\" and \"green gulper,\" but adventurers know it simply as the giant flytrap.</p><p>As the giant flytrap's prey are generally much smarter than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive hunter than its smaller brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A giant flytrap's jaws and stalks are swift-moving-it reaches out and snaps at passersby with lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an attack against a powerful foe.</p><p>While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as one, and others eight or more.</p><p>As a general rule, you should increase a giant flytrap's HD by 2 and its natural armor bonus by +1 for each additional bite attack you give it, increasing its CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and HD in this manner. If you increase the plant by more than 3 or 4 bites (and thus by more than 6 or 8 Hit Dice), consult Table 1-1 on page 291 to make sure that the plant's CR remains appropriate.</p><p>A giant flytrap's stalks are 20 feet long, but generally sprawl relatively close to the central mass-a set of full-grown flytrap jaws is 7 feet across. A giant flytrap weighs 9,000 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or grove (3-6)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(13d8+91)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 25, Dex 18, Con 25, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 192, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth), Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "17", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in undergrowth", "AC": "22, touch 12, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Giant Flytrap", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +10, Stealth +9 (+17 in undergrowth)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate swamps", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +17, Ref +8, Will +5", "Melee": "4 bites +15 (1d8+7 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
