Whatever their origin, nysrocks are thoroughly evil and contemptible caring for no one other than themselves.</p><p>Nysrocks are often found in the courts of various demon lords serving as advisors and counselors. Their cunning intellects are used to full effect by their masters in weaving battle plans and plots and intrigues against rival lords and enemies.</p><p>Rumors abound as of late (supposedly from an eyewitness who lived to tell the tale) of an abyssal plane ruled by a massive nysrock at least 40 feet long. Its palace is a network of underground tunnels populated with all manner of snakes, fiendish serpents, and intelligent and cunning reptiles of all shapes and sizes.</p><p>A nysrock ranges in size from 14 to 16 feet long and weigh 350 to 450 pounds. Its scales are blackish-blue and its eyes are golden and glint with a cunning spark. Its barbed tail is jet black and oozes a vile smelling poison when the creature is threatened.</p><p>A nysrock flares its hood before it enters combat as a warning to its opponents. Those that press combat are met with a vicious bite and venomous tail sting. A creature that is bitten is grabbed and wrapped in the monster's coils. A nysrock derives great pleasure in repeatedly stinging a grappled foe. Once a grappled foe expires, the nysrock releases its hold and consumes it whole so long as it faces no more enemies (nysrocks aren't stupid and do not ignore other enemies in order to feed).</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(15d10+120)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 14, Con 26, Int 16, Wis 19, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "spit +16 (poison)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2449, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (poison), Alertness, Cleave, Combat Casting, Great Fortitude, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (bite), Weapon Focus (sting)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "19", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "25, touch 11, flat-footed 23", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Nysrock Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +22, Escape Artist +20, Intimidate +22, Knowledge (planes) +21, Perception +34, Sense Motive +26, Spellcraft +21, Stealth +16, Survival +22", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +19, Ref +11, Will +9", "Melee": "bite +22 (2d6+7 plus grab), sting +22 (2d4+7 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
