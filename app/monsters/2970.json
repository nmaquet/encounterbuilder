They are not averse to taking up residence near civilized lands, and some actually prefer it, as it simply widens the grounds in which they can work their vile magic.</p><p>Redcaps hate humans and most other good-aligned fey creatures (especially brownies, grigs, and pixies). Though not combat-minded, they often go out of their way to kill good-aligned fey if given the chance.</p><p>Redcaps sometimes work with evil fey such as grimstalkers (see their entry in this book), but such alliances are usually short-lived.</p><p>Hunting bands are not uncommon, especially at night, and during these hunts redcaps are most often encountered carrying their poisoned daggers (which they use to fell opponents larger or stronger than themselves).</p><p>They enjoy traveling into civilized areas and stealing livestock and pets, just to see the sorrowful looks on the faces of the farmers and children the next day when they find their animals missing or slaughtered.</p><p>Redcaps prefer to dress in greens, browns, or other drab colors, except their hats. They gruesomely display, their long blood-soaked soaked caps, turned deep crimson to have slain. Generally, the avoid combat, preferring to harass those they encounter until such time as the redcap can strike with the advantage (such as against a sleeping or helpless opponent).</p><p>They normally throw stones or poisoned daggers at opponents before turning invisible and dashing away. Sleeping or helpless opponents are attacked with dagger or short sword, both of which are usually poisoned.</p><p>If cornered or threatened, a redcap turns invisible and attempts to slip away.</p><p>Aconite Poison: <i>Type</i> injury; save DC 15; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Elven, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-4) or band (5-12)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d6+1)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 7, Dex 19, Con 12, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 14", "Gear": "4 doses of aconite poison; Other Gear dagger", "Ranged": "dagger +6 (1d2-2 plus poison)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2970, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge B, Improved Initiative B, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception, +4 Stealth in forests.", "AC": "18, touch 16, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Redcap", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +6, Craft (poisonmaking) +6, Craft (any one) +6, Escape Artist +8, Perception +8, Stealth +8 (+12 in forests)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm forest and underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "poison use", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +8, Will +3", "Melee": "tiny short sword +6 (1d3-2 plus poison) or 2 claws +6 (1d2-2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Tiny"}
