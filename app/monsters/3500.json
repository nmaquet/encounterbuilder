They sustain themselves on a diet of plankton, aquatic plants, small crabs, and small fish. Larger stingrays, like smaller rays, are found in shallow, warm waters, though these creatures often swim into much deeper waters. Giant stingrays feed on creatures such as fish, giant crabs, octopus, and sharks. They are more aggressive than their smaller counterparts and often engage prey larger than themselves, relying on their poison to bring down a foe.</p><p>Female stingrays are usually larger than males. Young stingrays resemble adult rays, but are much smaller in size. During birth, the young's pectoral fins are folded against its body but open as soon as it is born.</p><p>Stingrays are completely flat with no discernible head. At one end is a long, whip-like tail that ends in a razor-sharp and serrated barb. Their eyes appear as small bumps on the end opposite the tail and their mouth is located on the underside of their body. The sides of a stingray are composed of large, wide pectoral fins (mistakenly referred to as wings sometimes). Stingrays are brown, black, or slate gray and their underbelly is white. Small stingrays are about three feet across, while the largest ray measures 12 feet across.</p><p>Small stingrays are generally inoffensive creatures. Most \"attacks\" occur in shallow waters when a creature steps on a buried ray. If stepped on, the stingray lashes out with its stinger. If threatened by an opponent much larger than it, the stingray attempts to sting its opponent and then flees.</p><p>Larger stingrays are more aggressive than their smaller counterparts, and some are very active when searching for prey. They are nocturnal hunters and attack using a tail sting or wing buffet.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or school (2-5)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d8+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 11, Con 17, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3500, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (poison), Multiattack, Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 9, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Large Stingray", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +11, Stealth +3, Swim +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +6, Will +3", "Melee": "sting +11 (1d8+6 plus poison), wing +9 (1d6+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
