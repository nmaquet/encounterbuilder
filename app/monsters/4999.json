The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Heated Flesh (Ex)</b> Any metal weapon striking a lava lizard must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 3d6 points of fire damage. Wooden weapons take double damage. Damage caused to weapons in this manner is not halved, but hardness does help prevent some of the damage dealt. Unarmed and natural attacks made against the lava lizard deal 2d6 points of fire damage to the attacker. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Lava Affinity (Ex)</b> A lava lizard can breathe and swim while submerged in lava and magma.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Lava lizards make their lairs in or near active volcanoes, spending their days swimming in the boiling magma. These creatures have few predators, save for some red dragons and fire giants. Lava lizards prefer to hunt during the day and sustain themselves on a diet of large game animals or whatever happens to wander close to their lair. Most prey is killed and carried back to the lair to be devoured later. Lava lizards often store their prey in magma pools as they prefer high temperature food. Lava lizards are about 10 feet long and weigh around 600 pounds. Their skin is always a shade of cherry red and their eyes are pale yellow. These creatures reproduce once per year on average with the female laying 4 to 6 large reddish eggs. These eggs are usually tucked away beneath a lava pool to not only incubate them, but also deter predators. Eggs hatch within 60 days and young reach maturity with 3 years. Lava lizards live about 100 years. Lava lizards generally avoid combat unless provoked, threatened, or hunting. In combat they assault their prey with their bite attempting to incinerate it as quickly as possible. Lava lizards that are outmatched flee if possible, seeking refuge in nearby magma pools or lava tubes where most attackers dare not venture.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or band (3-8)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(9d10+36 plus 9)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4999, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Skill Focus (Perception), ToughnessB, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 10, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Lava Lizard", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +18, Perception +11, Stealth +2, Swim +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "lava affinity", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +9, Will +5", "Melee": "bite +14 (3d8+7 plus burn)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
