They are begotten upon the world as the results of vile rituals in which cultists call down the essence of Yog-Sothoth from beyond the stars to impregnate a humanoid creature, for the Outer God is not of this dimension or world; only by incorporating flesh and bone of a mortal can its spawn exist. Upon death, a spawn's flesh rapidly melts until nothing but a crusty stain remains.</p><p>Ancient legend holds that the spawn of Yog-Sothoth are inflicted upon a world to clear it of all sane life and to prepare the way for the return of the Great Old Ones to their former dominion. Yet a spawn's ravenous and constant thirst for blood may be just as responsible for driving it to heights of mayhem and destruction that mark its presence in a region.</p><p>A spawn of Yog-Sothoth grows quickly to the size presented here, but if it continues to feed, it also continues to grow, albeit at a lesser rate. A truly ancient spawn of Yog-Sothoth can be the size of a barn or even a small hill.</p><p>Not all spawn of Yog-Sothoth are as massive or inhuman as the one presented here. Some (often twins to their more monstrous kin) remain roughly humanoid in shape and size, although their deformities are so great that they must wear disguises or several layers of baggy clothing in order to walk unchallenged in civilized regions. These sinister creatures have a wide range of strange and unusual abilities and appearances.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo", "Source": "Carrion Hill", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(14d8+70)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 15, Con 21, Int 17, Wis 17, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4071, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Multiattack, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (tentacles)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "24, touch 11, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Spawn Of Yog-Sothoth", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +33, Escape Artist +19, Intimidate +22, Knowledge (arcana) +17, Perception +20, Spellcraft +20, Stealth +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "12", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate hills", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +8, Will +12", "Melee": "1 bite +17 (1d8+8/19-20), 4 tentacles +16 (1d6+4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
