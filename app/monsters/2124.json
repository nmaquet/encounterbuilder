As a move action, they can detach a bulb and give it to another creature. If consumed as a standard action, this air cyst grants <i>water breathing</i> (as the spell) for 10 minutes. Seaweed leshys can have a maximum of four usable air cysts at any one time, and air cysts regrow at a rate of one per 24 hours. </h5><h5><b>Water Jet (Ex)</b> A seaweed leshy can expel a high-pressure jet of water from its mouth to a range of 30 feet. It must make a ranged touch attack to strike a target-if it hits, the blast deals 1 point of bludgeoning damage (this damage is not modified by Strength). In addition, the creature hit must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be blinded by the water for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Seaweed leshys usually dwell along coastlines, happily splashing and playing in tide pools, but they are equally at home at sea, floating among large kelp beds. Although perfectly capable of existing out of water indefinitely, seaweed leshys prefer to limit their time away from the sea almost out of a sense of pride. Most seaweed leshys take a dim view of freshwater plant life, to the point of mocking such plants in the same way an urbanite might talk down to folk who live in more rural areas. Rumors of freshwater leshys are a sure way to bring peals of mocking laughter from a seaweed leshy. Seaweed leshys resemble miniature, waterlogged green humans grown from leafy green seaweed, with skinny arms and legs, webbed hands and feet, and long strands of brown, green, or red seaweed for hair. They wear armor made from a pair of large clam shells or from several smaller shells tied together. This armor functions as a suit of masterwork padded armor for a seaweed leshy, but not for any other creature. Patient and thoughtful by inclination (save for matters associated with those silly freshwater leshys), seaweed leshys believe that in time nature brings what is needed by the ebb and flow of the tide or the steady flow of the river. They counsel against hasty decisions and rash actions, always preferring to wait and see what another day might bring. <br><b>GROWING A SEAWEED LESHY</b><br> Seaweed leshys must be grown in seawater. The leshy's maker plants a strand of kelp or other seaweed in the water and treats it daily with bone ash to encourage algal growth. When first created, a seaweed leshy has no armor, but can construct it from available materials given a day and left to its own devices (no Craft check required). <br><b>SEAWEED LESHY</b><br> </h5><h5><b>CL </b>10th; </h5><h5><b>Price </b>4,500 gp </h5><h5><b>RITUAL </b> </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>summon nature's ally III</i>, <i>water breathing</i>; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Knowledge (nature) DC 16; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>2,250 gp</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Druidic, Sylvan; plantspeech (seaweed)", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 3", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or patch (2-16)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 9, Wis 15, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "water jet +5 (1 plus blind)", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2124, "SubType": "(aquatic, leshy, shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (water jet), Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth and Survival in water", "AC": "15, touch 12, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Seaweed Leshy", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +7, Stealth +9 (+13 in water), Survival +3 (+7 in water), Swim +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any ocean or coastline", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "air cyst, amphibious, change shape (Small seaweed; tree shape), verdant burst", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +2, Will +3", "Melee": "slam +4 (1d6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
