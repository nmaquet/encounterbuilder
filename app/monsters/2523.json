No one is quite sure how the dracolisk species came to be, but all who have encountered it are well aware of its lethality. There is believed to be one species of dracolisk for every species of dragon. Thus far, however, most dracolisks encountered have been of the black variety. At first glance, a dracolisk appears to be a juvenile dragon of whatever color its dragon parent was-but thanks to the petrifying gaze it inherited from its basilisk parent, most who encounter a dracolisk never get a second glance. A dracolisk has a scaled body the same color as its dragon parent that fades to a lighter shade on its underside. A short, curved horn, similar to a rhino's, juts from its nose. Its dragon-like wings match its body color but fade to a slightly darker shade near the tips. A dracolisk's eyes are pale green with sparkles that match its dragon-parent color.</p><p>A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs about 3,000 pounds.</p><p>A dracolisk's environment varies based on its dragon heritage: black dracolisks can be found in warm marshes, deserts, or underground; blue dracolisks favor warm hills and mountains, rarely being found underground; green dracolisks favor temperate or warm forests and underground settings; red dracolisks favor warm mountains and underground settings; and white dracolisks favor cold mountains, cold deserts, and underground.</p><p>The dracolisk attacks first with its breath weapon and gaze attack. After this, it attacks with its bite and clawed forelegs.</p><p>Credit The Dracolisk originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or colony (3-6)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d12+44)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 14, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2523, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Improved Vital Strike, Power Attack, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "24, touch 11, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Dracolisk", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +14, Diplomacy +8, Fly +10, Intimidate +8, Perception +10, Sense Motive +10, Stealth +5, Survival +8, Swim +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "see text", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +9, Will +8", "Melee": "bite +16 (2d6+6), 2 claws +16 (1d6+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.
