Those hearing the song must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become captivated by the sound. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same sirine flower's song for one day. A victim under the effects of this ability moves toward the sirine flower using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sirine flower simply stands and offers no resistance to the sirine flower's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the sirine flower sings and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus. </h5><h5><b>Essence Drain (Su)</b> A grabbed creature takes normal damage plus 1d2 points of Intelligence damage each round until it escapes.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Sirine flowers are sentient, slow-moving, flesh-eating, 5-foot tall flowers with many thick stalks and leaves. The flower emits a pleasant odor noticeable to a range of 30 feet. They are most often found in dense forests near other plants where they sit waiting for prey to move within range. Typical prey for a sirine flower includes small birds, rodents, and other such creatures. Such creatures supply the sirine flower with sustenance for a time, but in order to gain the nutrients it needs to sustain it, the sirine flower must kill an intelligent creature and feed on its essence. The sirine flower typically stands about 5 feet tall from base to the tip of its stalks. They can grow to a height of nearly 10 feet, though flowers this large are uncommon at best. The base of a sirine flower is a thick, leathery, brown-colored sac about 2 feet in diameter, located just beneath the surface of the ground. Strong, thick roots grow in all directions from the base, reaching lengths of 5 to 6 feet. Above ground, a thick clump of leaves grows from the base of the plant. From these leaves a series of 6 to 10 stalks reach upward. Each stalk is thick, slightly coarse and leathery to the touch with many small leaves and flowers growing from it. Flowers are red, amber, gold, silver, bronze, purple, or gray. Hidden among the base leaves and stalks are the creature's four tendrils which it uses to ensnare its prey. The tendrils, like the stalks, are grayish-brown in color. The sirine flower begins combat using its charm ability to lure its prey in where it can attack with its tendrils. Once an opponent is within range, it lashes out, attempting to grab the foe with its tendrils. A grabbed opponent is held and drained of its Intelligence until it escapes, is slain, or rendered unconscious (and helpless). Unconscious foes are slain and devoured by the sirine flower's roots but only if all other attackers have been slain, rendered unconscious, or fled. If the sirine flower still faces aggressors, it turns its attention to them. Only when all are defeated or fled, does the sirine flower digest its meal.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or grove (3-5)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5059, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Weapon Focus (tendril)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+10 Stealth (in undergrowth)", "AC": "15, touch 10, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sirine Flower", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +9, Stealth +8 (+18 in undergrowth)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests or marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +1, Will +2", "Melee": "4 tendrils +6 (1d4+2 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
