Starting on the round after she consumes the merope, the thriae seer gains an insight bonus to her AC and on damage done with melee attacks equal to her Wisdom modifier (+6 for most thriae seers). </h5><h5><b>Mind Sting (Su)</b> A target stung by a thriae seer becomes confused for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a successful DC 21 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Their prowess for foretelling the future and deciding upon the soundest courses of action in dire situations earns them respect from other thriae as well as outsiders from other societies, and seers wield their gift with a stoic humbleness. Nonetheless, most seers expect an offering before they will grant an audience a <i>divination</i>. These offerings usually consist of ornate jewelry and sums of gold, though some seers desire the company of humanoid male or female consorts, many of whom gladly oblige the captivating seer with their presence. While their combative abilities mainly comprise their magical powers and they appear at first glance to be thin and frail, seers still possess the trademark strength and resilience of all thriae. Thriae seers spend most of their time meditating in one of the many chambers in the colony's hive dedicated to such activities. Consuming large amounts of their queen's merope to enhance their powers of <i>divination</i>, seers ponder the best solutions to their colony's problems, and often act as a sort of spiritual political council for the queen. If a particularly wealthy group of outsiders has sought the counsel of several thriae seers, this council of prophetesses will combine their powers in order to read a difficult <i>divination</i>. Thriae seers are 6 feet from head to toe and weigh 150 pounds. The thriae seer presented here represents the least of her kind. Many thriae seers take levels of monk or rogue so as to be even more adept at protecting their queen. Thriae oracles and sorcerers are also relatively common-such thriae are particularly valued by their hive for their magical abilities.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan, Thriae", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 3", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or triad", "Ref": "16", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(14d10+56)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 20, Con 19, Int 19, Wis 22, Cha 27", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2211, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Agile Maneuvers, Alertness, Combat Casting, Combat Reflexes, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Lightning Reflexes, Two-Weapon Fighting", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "25, touch 15, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Thriae Seer", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +22, Diplomacy +22, Fly +26, Knowledge (arcana) +18, Perception +27, Sense Motive +24, Spellcraft +18, Use Magic Device +22", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "15", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +16, Will +15", "Melee": "+2 quarterstaff +16/+11/+6 (1d6+4), +2 quarterstaff +16/+11 (1d6+3), sting +11 (1d8+3 plus mind sting)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.
