In the Celestial Hierarchy she was a member of the Cherubim and served alongside Gabriel, Raphael, and Ophaniel.</p><p>During the Unholy Schism, she sided with Lucifer and aided him by seducing another Cherub wherein Lucifer caught the angel unaware and murdered him on the spot.</p><p>When Lucifer was thrown down from the good-aligned planes, Demoriel was beside him; cast out for the sin of slaying another angel and spilling the blood of an angel in the outer planes. When Lucifer envisioned Hell, Demoriel envisioned herself on the throne next to him, serving as Hell's Queen. Unfortunately for her, she became one of his many concubines but never his bride, for the Great Uprising occurred in Hell and the other arch-devils moved to destroy Lucifer and his court. When Lucifer was removed from Hell's Throne and took up residence in a pocket plane called Infernus, Demoriel followed. Once again, she was denied her place on the throne next to Lucifer as he took a devil named Shabiri as his consort. Though Demoriel remains ever loyal to Lucifer, she does not trust nor like Shabiri. For now she waits until her time comes when she can discredit or destroy Shabiri and replace her as Lucifer's consort.</p><p>Though Lucifer no longer rules Hell, Demoriel still serves him unswervingly. She follows no other, though she is more than willing to lead other creatures to their demise by feigning loyalty to them. She has a particularly vile hatred for celestials (more than other devils do it seems) and enjoys corrupting and destroying them.</p><p>Demoriel attacks with her spell-like abilities, attempting to charm the strongest opponents she faces. If forced into melee, she attacks with her spell-like abilities and short sword or summons other devils to fight for her while she maintains a position away from the immediate fight.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Giant, Ignan, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Demoriel plus 1-4 horned devils)", "Ref": "17", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(20d10+100)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 21, Con 20, Int 23, Wis 23, Cha 31", "Gear": "Reaver", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2510, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Deceitful, Great Cleave, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Persuasive, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (fireball), Power Attack, Weapon Focus (short sword)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Bluff, +8 Diplomacy", "AC": "40, touch 25, flat-footed 35", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Demoriel", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +45, Diplomacy +45, Disguise +37, Fly +28, Intimidate +37, Knowledge (arcana) +29, Knowledge (planes) +29, Knowledge (religion) +26, Perception +33, Sense Motive +33, Stealth +28, Survival +26", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "20", "Race": "", "CR": "19", "XP": 204800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Infernus)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +17, Will +20; +2 on all saves from spells and effects from good-aligned creatures", "Melee": "+3 unholy short sword +30/+25/+20/+15 (1d6+9/19- 20) or 2 claws +26 (1d6+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
