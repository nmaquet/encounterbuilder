All creatures within 60 feet that hear the sound must make a successful DC 13 Will save or take 1d6 points of sonic damage each round they remain in the area. The screaming also distracts spellcasters attempting to cast spells. A spellcaster within the area must make a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + sonic damage taken) to successfully cast a spell. The screaming lasts for 1d4 rounds before ceasing for one round. After that, the skull remains silent unless a creature is within or moves within 40 feet of it-it then screams again and repeats the above cycle. The save DC is Constitution-based. Additionally, this cacophonous scream risks attracts wandering monsters. Whenever the skull first screams, the GM makes an additional wandering monster check to determine if nearby creatures come to investigate the source of the disturbance. </h5><h5><b>Insanity (Su)</b> Physically touching the screaming skull (including attacks with natural weapons and unarmed attacks) requires the opponent to make a successful DC 13 Will save or be stricken insane as by an <i>insanity</i> spell (caster level 6th). The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Screaming skulls are immobile guardians created with the purpose of guarding or protecting a specific object or area. They are often used in concert with other monsters as their screaming alerts other creatures to the presence of intruders. A screaming skull obeys its commands to the letter. Should its creator die or should the screaming skull be unable to carry out its commands, its magical nature ceases to function and it becomes nothing more than a normal skull. Its gemstone eyes dull to a lackluster gray, effectively becoming worthless stones.</p><p>A screaming skull sits undisturbed until a creature moves within 30 feet of it when it unleashes its hellish scream. Other creatures are subjected to its <i>magic missile</i> attack. The screaming skull is a relentless guardian and continues its assault until it is destroyed or its foes leave the area. The gemstones that function as the screaming skull's eyes can be pried from a destroyed skull by making a successful DC 20 Strength check. The gems retain their value after the screaming skull is destroyed.</p><p><br><b>Construction</b><br> A screaming skull is created from the skull of a Medium or larger humanoid or other such creature. A single gemstone worth at least 500 gp must be inserted into each eye socket during construction (total cost 1,000 gp).</p><p>SCREAMING SKULL <br><b>CL</b> 8th; <b>Price</b> 15,000 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>insanity</i>, <i>magic missile</i>, <i>shout</i>, creator must be at least 8th level; <b>Skill</b> Craft (jewelry) DC 13 or Heal check DC 15; <b>Cost</b> 8,500 gp + 560 XP.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "0", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex -, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2986, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "Cacophony Golem", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "13, touch 7, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Screaming Skull", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref 0, Will +2", "Melee": "", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "0 ft., immobile", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Tiny"}
