Most Shobhads are born and come of age in one of the fierce tribal clans known collectively as the Shobhad-neh, and disdain the \"soft living\" practiced by other humanoid races, seeing in the abandonment of nomadic culture a slippery slope that leads away from individual honor and into marginalization. Whether with flashing swords and lances or the mysterious longrifles capable of picking off targets on faraway horizons, the clans of the Shobhad-neh vie constantly for resources in the hard deserts and mountains where they live, their need to survive trumped only by a still greater desire for honor. While considered barbaric by many, the Shobhad-neh operate under strict codes of conduct that dictate how a warrior may gain status via ritualistic challenges or daring coups in territorial squabbles. Unfortunately for other races, these rules almost always apply exclusively to interactions with other Shobhads, and \"lesser\" races are frequently seen as little more than sheep to be culled by the Shobhad wolves. Typical shobhad warriors stand 12 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds, and their lean bodies are corded with ropes of muscle. Clothing is either practical-such as hide armor and wrappings to protect against biting sandstorms-or ceremonial, with chieftains and shamans wearing brightly colored skins and feathers, yet most shobhads prefer to go naked save for loincloths and the all-important leather harnesses that crisscross their chests and secure their weapons. While Shobhads are occasionally found alone in the various cities of Akiton, such urban individuals are the exception rather than the rule. In a human city, their shamans preach, an individual is little more than a faceless cog in a machine, remembered by none. Yet a shobhad warrior who rides heroically into battle atop her armored reptilian steed is never forgotten-not by her own kin, nor by the families of those she defeats. Thus, in battle, a Shobhad is made immortal.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Shobhad", "Source": "Distant Worlds", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, raiding party (3-19), or clan (20+ plus 1 sergeant of 3rd-4th level per 10 adults and 1 leader of 5th-7th level)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 13, Con 18, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "shobhad longrifle* +6 (2d6/4)", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2506, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Multiweapon FightingB, Weapon Focus (shobhad longrifle*)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 10, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Shobhad", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +9, Perception +8, Stealth +2, Survival +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold deserts and mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +4", "Melee": "longsword +5 (2d6+5/19-20), longsword +5 (2d6+2/19-20), 2 claws +4 (1d6+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.
