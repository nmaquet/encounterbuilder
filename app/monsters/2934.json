A creature that successfully saves is immune to the fear effect of the same poltergeist for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Natural Invisibility (Su)</b> This ability is constant, allowing a poltergeist to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent, cannot be dispelled or negated, and is not subject to the <i>invisibility purge</i> spell. </h5><h5><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> Like ghosts, it's difficult to destroy a poltergeist through simple combat: the \"destroyed\" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Unlike ghosts, powerful spells such as <i>dispel evil</i> usually are effective. Short of that, however, the only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM. </h5><h5><b>Telekinesis (Su)</b> A poltergeist can create a telekinetic effect to hurl one object or creature within 10 feet to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). This ability functions as the violent thrust version of the <i>telekinesis</i> spell (caster level 10th) with the following exceptions: the poltergeist can hurl only one object or creature per round; the poltergeist uses its Charisma modifier (usually +2) to modify its base attack bonus. A creature targeted by this ability can make a DC 13 Will save to avoid being hurled by the poltergeist. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Unnatural Aura (Su)</b> Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of a poltergeist at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Poltergeists are undead spirits that haunt the area where they died.
