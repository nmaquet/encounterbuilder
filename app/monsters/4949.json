Affected creatures must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Those making their save are blinded for 1d4+4 rounds. Those failing their save take 10d6 points of damage. A creature that makes its save is immune to the annihilating wail of that galley beggar for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Draining Touch (Su)</b> The incorporeal touch of a galley beggar drains 1d4 points of Charisma. On a successful attack, the galley beggar also heals 5 points of damage to itself. </h5><h5><b>Incorporeal Touch (Su)</b> By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the galley beggar inflicts 5d6+3 damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted. </h5><h5><b>Unholy Touch (Su)</b> A galley beggar adds its Charisma modifier to damage for its incorporeal touch attack.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Galley beggars are the ghostly remains of travelers who met their demise before their journey was complete. Therefore most encounters with galley beggars occur on roads and paths between cities and towns. A galley beggar generally haunts a single area of no more than 1 square mile, and though it is not tied to the area, it rarely ever ventures far from the place where it died. A galley beggar is a hateful creature, unhappy and resentful of its current state of unlife. It seeks nothing more than to kill any living creature it encounters. Galley beggars are believed to speak Common and at least one other language, though sages are unsure of this as no galley beggar has ever conversed with a living creature (or at least conversed with any living creature that lived to tell about it). A galley beggar begins combat the instant it encounters a living creature. It opens a battle using its annihilating wail if any opponent is within range by extending a skeletal arm and showing its severed head to its foes. If no opponent is within range the galley beggar moves in and uses its annihilating wail as soon as possible. It follows this with its incorporeal or draining touch.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d8+30 plus 10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 15, Con -, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4949, "SubType": "(incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception, +8 Stealth", "AC": "16, touch 16, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Galley Beggar", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +8, Diplomacy +8, Fly +23, Intimidate +16, Knowledge (any) +6, Perception +19, Sense Motive +11, Stealth +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +7, Will +8", "Melee": "incorporeal touch +9 (5d6+3, DC 18 Fort half) or incorporeal drain +9 (1d4 Cha drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 50 ft.
