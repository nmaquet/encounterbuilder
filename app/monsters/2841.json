Use the statistics for the undead raven swarm found elsewhere in this book. These smaller crows continue to relentlessly attack all living creatures within sight. </h5><h5><b>Eye Rake (Ex)</b> If a murder crow hits an opponent with both claws in the same round, the victim must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or be blinded as the crow scratches and tears at the victim's eyes. The blindness last for 1d4 days while the eyes naturally heal, or until healed (with <i>remove blindness</i> or a successful DC 15 Heal check). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Murder crows are undead avians found haunting cemeteries, graveyards, and charnel houses where they feast on the carcasses of humanoids, animals, and other once living creatures. These creatures are formed in desolate areas where the formless souls of birds condense into a solitary creature-a murder crow. Murder crows attack with their jagged beaks and sinister talons. Rarely does a murder crow face its adversaries on the ground, preferring instead to execute a flyby attack, enhancing this attack with its special eye rake ability.</p><p>Murder crows resemble standard crows except that they stand nearly 4 feet tall with a wingspan of 9 feet. Their tattered feathers are black and carry the stench of death. The eyes of a murder crow are bleak and hollow, showing no signs of emotion or life. Murder crows possess an intelligence level similar to that of their living counterparts; however, they have a great level of awareness that allows them to hunt and kill in a much more proficient manner.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Lance Hawvermale.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-4), or murder (10-90)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d8+27)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 20, Con -, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2841, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Toughness, Wingover", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 16, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Murder Crow", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +10, Stealth +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +8, Will +8", "Melee": "2 claws +7 (1d4+1), 1 bite +7 (1d6+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
