Although other gaseous creatures can issue under the crack of a door, a cinder ghoul cannot. A cinder ghoul can, however, make slam attacks, retains its natural armor bonus, and all supernatural attacks. Spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities affect them normally. A cinder ghoul cannot enter water or other liquid. It is not ethereal or incorporeal, and is affected by winds or other forms of moving air to the extent that the wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving. However, even the strongest wind can't disperse or damage a cinder ghoul. Because it contains burning embers and small bits of perpetually smoldering flesh, a cinder ghoul cannot hide and gets no bonuses to Stealth checks in an area of mist, smoke, or other gas. </h5><h5><b>Smoke Inhalation (Su)</b> As a standard action, a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its smoky form into the lungs of a living opponent. To initiate this attack it must move into its target's space. The target must then make a successful DC 18 Fortitude save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside the victim's lungs burns the surrounding tissues and organs, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round. The affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each round to cough out the burning residue. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>A creature that is burned to death by magical fire may rise again as a fiery undead being called a cinder ghoul. The lairs of old red dragons may be haunted by many of these pathetic, angry spirits, and many a wizard that has dispatched a foe with a well-placed <i>fireball</i> has been found mysteriously charred to death many months after the deed.</p><p>Cinder ghouls are barely intelligent, but they do have a very vivid recollection of the pain they endured in the moments before their death.</p><p>Filled with anger as fiery as the flames that took their life, cinder ghouls harbor a strong hatred of fire and any living creature that has control over it.</p><p>Although it cannot speak, the sound of wailing and screaming and the rushing of fire-stoked wind constantly accompany a cinder ghoul.</p><p>In melee a cinder ghoul slams with the charred remains of its fists. If a cinder ghoul encounters an opponent that demonstrates any form of control over fire-either through casting a fire spell or using a magic item that produces fire-it attacks that opponent to the exclusion of all others.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), or mob (6-11)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d8+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 20, Con -, Int 4, Wis 12, Cha 19", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2627, "SubType": "(fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 15, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Cinder Ghoul", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +18, Perception +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +9, Will +7", "Melee": "slam +10 (1d8+4 plus 1d6 fire plus burn plus energy drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 40 ft.
