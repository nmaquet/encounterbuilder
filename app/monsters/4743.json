While generally sustaining themselves on a diet of foliage and grasses, they sometimes scavenge the remains of creatures killed by other predators. Like most beetles, a ravager has a thick plated carapace and two large mandibles it uses to crush and chew its food. Its carapace is black in color with several white streaks crisscrossing it. Its mandibles are dark bluish-black. Its wing covers are black with hints of gold. A typical ravager beetle is about 4 feet long. Ravagers have a single life cycle that spans an entire year. Females generally lay 4-8 eggs in soft earth or soil and within two weeks the larva emerges. Young are almost always born in the warmer spring and early summer months. Young are noncombatants and rely solely on their mother for protection and food, feeding generally for 10 days before entering the pupa stage. After about 20 days, the pupae become adults. Ravager beetles are generally scavengers by nature, and rarely attack, except in times when food is scarce. Even then, they usually limit their attacks to weakened, sleeping, wounded, or otherwise incapacitated prey. When attacking, ravager beetles lock onto an opponent with their mandibles and continue biting and crushing the target until it is dead.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, cluster (3-8) or nest (9-20)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 10, Con 14, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4743, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 10, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ravager Beetle", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly -4", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +1, Will +1", "Melee": "bite +6 (1d8+4 plus poison and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 20 ft.
