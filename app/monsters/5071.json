Crush attacks are effective only against opponents one or more size categories smaller than the frog stone idol. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the stone idol's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the stone idol moves off them. If the stone idol chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. </h5><h5><b>Powerful Leaper (Ex)</b> A frog stone idol uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics checks made to jump, and it has a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> A stone idol is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell <i>slow</i>s a stone idol (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while <i>transmute mud to rock</i> heals all of its lost hit points. A <i>stone to flesh</i> spell does not actually change the stone idol's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round. A <i>disintegrate</i> spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol. A <i>chaos hammer</i>, <i>holy smite</i>, <i>order's wrath</i>, or <i>unholy blight</i> spell deals 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells. </h5><h5><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in 1d4+2 days. </h5><h5><b>Site Bound (Ex)</b> A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it is brought back into the area.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A stone idol frog is about 10 feet long and weighs 10,000 pounds. It leaps at its foes attempting to crush as many as it can before resorting to its powerful bite attack. <br><b>Variant Frog Stone Idol</b><br> The stone idol frog detailed above is not the only known to exist. One such variant is detailed below. <br><b>Tsathogga Frog Stone Idol:</b> This creature is identical to the standard stone idol frog. It also gains the following special attack. <br><b>Vile Croak (Su) </b>Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a Tsathogga idol can unleash a croak that affects all that hear it within 60 feet. Affected creatures take 5d6 points of negative energy damage. A DC 16 Will save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. <br><b>Construction</b><br> A stone idol frog is chiseled from a block of smooth stone that weighs at least 3,000 pounds. It must be of exceptional quality and have a value of not less than 5,000 gp. <br><b>FROG STONE IDOL</b><br> <b>CL</b> 10th; <b>Price</b> 69,000 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>wall of stone</i>, creator must be caster level 10th; <b>Skill</b> Craft (sculpting) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 16; <b>Cost</b> 37,000 gp.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d10+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5071, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Acrobatics when jumping", "AC": "20, touch 9, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Frog Stone Idol", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +0 (+8 jumping)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "powerful leaper, site bound", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +13 (2d6+7)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
