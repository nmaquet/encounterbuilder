Androids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects, are not subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and are immune to disease and sleep effects. Androids can never gain morale bonuses, and are immune to fear effects and all emotion-based effects. </h5><h5><b>Emotionless (Ex)</b> Androids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a -4 penalty on Sense Motive checks. </h5><h5><b>Nanite Surge (Ex)</b> An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate action, an android can cause her nanites to surge, granting a bonus equal to 3 + the android's character level on any one d20 roll; this ability must be activated before the roll is made. When an android uses this power, her circuitry-tattoos glow with light equivalent to that of a torch in illumination for 1 round.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Of the numerous wonders and horrors that emerge from the technological ruins of Numeria, the androids who periodically crawl from the wreckage are among the most eerie and amazing. Though they appear to be almost human, these artificial wonders are of a completely foreign and utterly alien nature. Androids are created, not born, and come into the world fully mature. The strange, alien \"forges\" in which new androids are created are hidden in strange ruins in Numeria, and most androids have little to no memories of these regions. Strange circuitry-like markings that look like faintly glowing tattoos, a faint metallic sheen to the eyes, and watery, almost translucent red blood are all ways to tell an android from a human-providing its awkward mannerisms haven't revealed the truth already. A typical android is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. <br><b>ANDROID CHARACTERS (16 RP)</b><br> Androids are defined by their class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice. All androids have the following racial traits. <br><b>+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma:</b> Androids have swift ref lexes and are very intelligent, but have difficulty relating to others. Exceptional Senses: Androids have darkvision to a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. <br><b>Constructed (2 RP):</b> See above. <br><b>Emotionless (-1 RP):</b> See above. <br><b>Nanite Surge (3 RP):</b> See above. <br><b>Languages:</b> Androids begin play speaking Common. Androids with high Intelligence can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Hallit, Varisian", "Source": "Inner Sea Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or platoon (3-12)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d8+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 14, Wis 10, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "1", "id": 3551, "SubType": "(android)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "rogue 1", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception, -4 Sense Motive", "AC": "15, touch 13, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Android", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +7, Climb +5, Disable Device +7, Escape Artist +7, Knowledge (engineering) +3, Knowledge (local) +6, Perception +6, Sense Motive +0, Sleight of Hand +7, Stealth +7", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "Android", "CR": "1/2", "XP": 200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Numeria)", "CharacterFlag": "1", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "emotionless, trapfinding +1", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +5, Will +0", "Melee": "rapier +3 (1d6+1/18-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
