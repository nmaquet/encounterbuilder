While flying, kongamatos can fit through areas up to half their width without suffering the penalties to movement and Armor Class and on attack rolls usually incurred for squeezing. </h5><h5><b>Piercing Beak (Ex)</b> A kongamato's beak is extremely hard and adept at breaking objects. When attempting to sunder an item, a kongamato's beak attack does double damage and is treated as if it were adamantine for the purposes of overcoming the object's hardness. </h5><h5><b>Wailing Dive (Su)</b> When a kongamato makes a charge while flying or uses its Flyby Attack feat, the creature's body becomes infused with energy, causing its bite to do an extra +1d6 points of sonic damage on that attack.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Kongamatos are primeval dragons that still hunt the deep jungles of the world. Although not as intelligent or magically adept as their \"true\" cousins, kongamatos are respected and feared for their resilience and awesome strength. While the kongamato's body is clearly draconic- squat and dense with sharp claws capping each of its four limbs-the creature's head is distinctly avian, with a long, toothless beak and a pronounced crest. A kongamato's hide is a rich emerald hue, with an ash-colored underbelly, and crimson webbing of its broad wings. Females have smaller head-crests than males, and both the undersides of their wings and their underbellies have a rosy hue.</p><p>Both males and females grow to a length of almost 30 feet, with an equally broad wingspan, and can weigh up to 7 tons. Kongamatos live between 500 and 600 years.<b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> Kongamatos are an ancient race of dragon, thought to be either a progenitor species to modern dragon-kind or the result of crossbreeding between dragons and pterosaurs.</p><p>Now found only in the deepest and hottest jungles, legends say that their numbers once darkened the skies. Such tales often go on to hail kongamatos as \"pure\" dragons, claiming that exposure to arcane magic caused the split between the original kongamato and what evolved into their chromatic and metallic cousins. Some even point to kongamatos as a missing link of sorts between dragons and the shrieking reptiles known as yrthaks.</p><p>Regardless of their origins, kongamatos are apex predators that make their lairs in the tops of the oldest and strongest trees, or in caves and ruins. Kongamatos are carnivorous and prey on large herd animals. Although they do not have teeth, their beaks are sharp and strong, allowing them to carve their kills with precision and to punch through wood, rock, and even metal. When possible, kongamatos hunt on the perimeter of their territories, their ability to fly through impossibly small places allowing them to hunt in even the thickest foliage.</p><p>The crest atop a kongamato's head houses a muscular labyrinth of valves and chambers that store and pressurize air. When the creature descends or draws in successive deep breaths, the valves fill and the muscles within condense the air into an almost solid state. When its crest is full, a kongamato can unleash the trapped air in a wave that travels over bones in the back of the creature's throat, vibrating them to generate an ear-splitting pitch.</p><p>The resultant blast can shatter stone, strip branches from trees, and crush bone with ease.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> Kongamatos are predominantly solitary as even a small group could risk overhunting an entire region. Females lay a single egg once per century, and during this mating season, males and females form a hunting pair until the egg is laid. After the male fertilizes the egg, the female curls her body around it for protection. Kongamato eggs can take up to a year to hatch. During this time, the male brings food to the incubating mother and greatly expands the range of his hunting territory in order to satisfy the needs of both parents. When the egg hatches, the father departs, returning to his own lair and leaving the mother to rear the hatchling. Hatchling kongamatos reach half of their adult size within the first 3 years of life-when the mother also departs to find or reclaim her own territory- and achieve reproductive maturity at 10 years.</p><p>Although kongamatos do not traditionally prey on humanoids, no creature is safe during the incubation season if a kongamato's food becomes scarce. In the Mwangi Expanse, some villages keep detailed, elaborate calendars dating back a hundred generations aimed solely at predicting when a nearby kongamato will reproduce.</p><p>In such years, all members of the community set aside a portion of their harvest or livestock as an offering to the \"pure dragons.\"</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "AP 42", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "16", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(18d12+141)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 34, Dex 17, Con 26, Int 9, Wis 14, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "15 ft", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1472, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Hover, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Lightning Reflexes, Multiattack, Power Attack, Snatch, Wingover", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "19", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "29, touch 11, flat-footed 26", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Kongamato", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +19, Fly +20, Intimidate +16, Perception +23, Sense Motive +15, Stealth +13, Survival +20", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "13", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "tropical forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "narrow flight, piercing beak", "Saves": "Fort +19, Ref +16, Will +13", "Melee": "bite +28 (2d6+18), 2 claws +26 (1d8+6), tail slap +26 (2d6+6), 2 wings +26 (1d8+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 160 ft.
