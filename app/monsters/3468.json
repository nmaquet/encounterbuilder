A creature stuffed into the giant hamster's cheek pouch takes no damage, and can escape by making a successful DC 16 Strength check or can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 10 points of damage to the cheek (AC 11). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another trapped opponent must cut its own way out. A Large hamster's cheek can hold 1 Small, 2 Tiny, or 8 Diminutive or smaller opponents. The check DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Immune (Ex)</b> Giant hamsters are immune to all diseases (magical and otherwise).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Giant hamsters are larger, slightly more aggressive relatives of the normal hamster. Like their smaller cousins, they come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. Giant hamsters are omnivorous, but prefer to feast on a diet of grains, berries, nuts, and water. On occasion, they indulge in and eat meat, usually insects and the like. Also like its smaller cousin, the giant hamster can store food in its cheek pouches. The average giant hamster can store about 200 pounds of food at any given time.</p><p>Giant hamsters normally shun combat, but if cornered or extremely hungry they may attack. Note that even domesticated giant hamsters attack if their young are threatened. The giant hamster attacks by biting with its long, sharp teeth.</p><p>Credit The Giant Hamster originally appeared in the Second Edition <i>Monstrous Compendium (MC 7)</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1990) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Wizards of the Coast.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "small pack (1d4 adults plus 10% chance of 1d4 young)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 13, Con 16, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3468, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Endurance, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 10, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Giant Hamster", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +9, Perception +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate hills", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +5, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +6 (1d8+6 plus grab)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., burrow 10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
