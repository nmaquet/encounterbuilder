The target can make a DC 17 Will save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the victim believes the kelpie to be a very beautiful and attractive creature, and attempts to move as quickly as possible toward the kelpie. The kelpie can automatically grapple a charmed foe and attempts to drown the victim. A charmed foe does not resist the kelpie's embrace, and the drowning attempt does not allow an additional save. Female creatures are immune to the kelpie's charm ability; only males can be affected. The charm is negated if the victim dies, the kelpie dies, or <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>greater dispelling</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> is cast on the victim. If the save is successful, the target cannot be affected by that kelpie's charm or charm touch for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. </h5><h5><b>Charm Touch (Su)</b> On a successful slam attack, a kelpie's target must make a DC 17 or be charmed as described under the charm ability above. This effect does not stack with that ability. </h5><h5><b>Reshape Form (Su)</b> A kelpie's natural form is that of a mass of dark green seaweed. It can assume three other forms. The first is a Small or Medium female humanoid. The second form is a hippocampus (see that entry). The third form is a Large green horse. In each form, the kelpie retains all of her special abilities. She does not truly alter her form (such as shapechangers do), she simply reshapes her body. In all of her forms, the kelpie's skin/fur has a greenish cast, and her features are slightly distorted. The kelpie's ruse can be detected if an opponent who is not charmed succeeds on a DC 10 Perception check. </h5><h5><b>Telepathy (Su)</b> A kelpie can communicate telepathically to a range of 1 mile with any creature she has touched.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>In their true form, kelpies are indistinguishable from normal seaweed.</p><p>They are found in saltwater and freshwater, swamps, fens, and stagnated underground pools and lakes. Sages and scholars believe the kelpies were created by an evil water elemental goddess. In her human guise, a kelpie appears as a beautiful female with long flowing dark hair, emerald eyes, and soft, pale skin. She is cloaked in robes of seaweed or wears nothing at all. A kelpie often assumes a semi-human form in which her lower torso is composed entirely of seaweed.</p><p>Kelpies lie in wait for their foes, and when a target moves within range, they reshape their form to appear human (in most cases, they take the form of a drowning woman) so as to lure the target closer. If the ruse is not detected and the opponent moves within 5 feet of the kelpie, she attacks, attempting to charm and drown her victim. Drowned foes are taken back to the kelpie's lair and devoured.</p><p>Credit The Kelpie originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S2 White Plume Mountain</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1979) and later in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Lawrence Schick.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common; telepathy 1 mile (see below)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or bed (1-4)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+5)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 8, Wis 13, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2770, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Skill Focus (Bluff)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 12, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Kelpie", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +7, Perception +5, Stealth +6, Swim +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +3, Will +4", "Melee": "slam +5 (1d4+2 plus grab plus charm touch)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
