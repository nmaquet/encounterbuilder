Bucentaurs are considered to be a blessing by many minotaur clans, and are often raised by minotaur priests to be kings and rulers of a minotaur tribe. Their battle prowess is legendary, the skulls of many heroes adorning the walls of their pen. Bucentaurs make their home in desolate forests and ruins, generally away from civilized races. They are fiercely territorial, attacking any who trespass their realm, including other bucentaur clans on occasion. Hunts are a standard occasion and can see up to six or eight of these creatures strike out to capture and kill large game. Bucentaurs stand almost 8 feet tall and weigh over 2,200 pounds. Skin colors vary widely, but most tend to be darker colors such as blacks or blackish-blue. Eyes are almost always dark. Bucentaurs typically live to 50 years of age. Bucentaurs are straightforward combatants, bull rushing and goring foes before cutting them down with their greataxes. They are savage creatures, and rarely flee from a fight, preferring to inflict as much damage as possible on their foes before the need to escape.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, band (3-6), or herd (7-16 plus leader of 10th-12th level)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 12, Con 16, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4757, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, Run", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +4 Survival", "AC": "16, touch 10, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Bucentaur", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Intimidate +9, Perception +14, Stealth +6, Survival +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests and plains or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +7, Will +7", "Melee": "greataxe +12/+7 (3d6+7), 2 hooves +7 (1d6+5), gore +7 (1d6+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
