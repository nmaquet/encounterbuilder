Most encounters are with a solitary drake. Only in the midsummer months is it common to find a mated pair or family. A salt drake's scales range from dull blue to midnight blue, and it is often mistaken for a young blue dragon. Salt drakes range from 8 feet to 30 feet long. Though difficult to train, salt drakes are favored as mounts by goblins, gnolls, and hobgoblins.</p><p>A salt drake's primary diet consists of large quantities of salt. This diet enables the drake to spew salt at its opponents. A salt drake opens combat from the air using its salt spray breath weapon. If unable to utilize its breath weapon, it relies on its claws and bite to finish off any remaining opponents.<br><b>Training a Salt Drake</b><br> A salt drake requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a salt drake must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly salt drake requires ten weeks of work and a DC 30 Handle Animal check. Riding a salt drake requires an exotic saddle. A salt drake can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p><p>Salt drake eggs are worth 6,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 12,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 2,000 gp to rear or train a dragonnel.<br><b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a salt drake is up to 516 pounds; a medium load, 517-1,038 pounds, and a heavy load, 1,039-1,560 pounds.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or clutch (2-5)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d12+33)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 13, Con 16, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "5 ft.
