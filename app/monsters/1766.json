It never attacks a foe that is using fire unless it is cornered or has no other obvious target. Morale Unless confronted by fire, a shriezyx fights to the death.</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>13, <b>Dex </b>17, <b>Con </b>12, <b>Int </b> 3, <b>Wis </b>12, <b>Cha </b>2</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+5; <b>CMB </b>+6; <b>CMD </b>19 (31 vs. trip)</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Step Up, Weapon Finesse</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Climb +15, Perception +12; <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+4 Perception</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Thassilonian</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any underground</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary, pair, or hive (3-12)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>incidental</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Fear of Fire (Ex)</b> A shriezyx within 30 feet of a fire the size of a torch or larger becomes shaken as long as it remains within that range. If damaged by fire, a shriezyx must make a Will save (DC equals the amount of fire damage dealt) or become frightened for 1 round. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite-injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 14; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Str; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>. </h5><h5><b>Slowing Toxin (Su)</b> A shriezyx's web is coated with a supernatural toxin that numbs and deadens the nerves on contact. Any creature struck by a shriezyx's web must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or become slowed (as per the spell) for 1 minute. Each round, a victim may attempt a new DC 14 Fortitude save to end the effect early. This toxin fades quickly from spun webs-it can only affect targets on the round the web is spun. Existing webs, while they remain sticky and tangled, do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>These man-sized, spiderlike creatures were made in Xin-Bakrakhan's fleshvats by one of Alaznist's predecessors, but Alaznist made extensive improvements to the crude originals. Her greatest gift to the shriezyx was fertility-before she gave them the ability to breed, their numbers were regulated by the commanding runelord.</p><p>Created to be an instinctive killing organism, these creatures often served as skirmishers in wars in which the sinspawn themselves served as infantry. Encased in thick, armorlike chitin, shriezyx are tenacious and hard to kill. They only have one built-in weakness: a fear of fire.</p><p>This was an intentional flaw that allowed the creatures' handlers, who were masters of manipulating magical flames, a way to control them. The creatures were set as a defensive mechanism against incursions into key locations in Bakrakhan; handlers could release the creatures and drive them toward intruders.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Thassilonian", "Source": "Dungeons Of Golarion", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or hive (3-12)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(7d8+7)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 3, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1766, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Step Up, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Shriezyx", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +15, Perception +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +8 (1d6+1 plus poison), 4 claws +8 (1d4+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
