A xacon that touches a wooden or earthen item (including the ground), increases its natural armor bonus to +5 (granting the xacon AC 17, touch 12, flat-footed 15). If the xacon touches a metal or stone item, its natural armor bonus increases to +8 (granting the xacon AC 20, touch 12, flat-footed 18). This bonus to its natural armor lasts for 1 minute. After using this ability, the xacon must wait 1d4 rounds before it uses it again. </h5><h5><b>Tree Meld (Su)</b> Once per day, a xacon can meld its body and possessions into a tree. This ability functions similar to a <i>meld into stone</i> spell with no duration.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Xacons are plant creatures that inhabit thickly wooded forests and forested hills and mountains. They act as protectors of nature, often times working with good- or neutral-aligned druids and other forest denizens when the area comes under attack or defilement by evil-aligned druids, foresters, and others who destroy the trees and surroundings without care or recourse. Xacons make their homes in treetops, using the largest and sturdiest of the trees to hold their dwellings (small wooden huts). A typical dwelling holds up to four of these creatures (who may or may not be an interrelated family). All inhabitants of a single dwelling are adults. No young xacons have ever been seen. Xacon reproduction methods are unknown but sages believe they procreate through some form of budding. Xacons stand 6 feet tall and weigh around 160 pounds. They seem to converse with others of their own kind through a series of hand signals and other gestures. They understand Sylvan but cannot speak. A xacon attacks by slashing and tearing at its foes with its thorny claws. During battle (or before battle if it is aware of its foes), a xacon contacts a natural object (such as a large stone or tree) in order to fortify its natural armor against its foes.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (3-6)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(4d8+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5102, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Stealthy", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in undergrowth", "AC": "14, touch 12, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Xacon", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +10, Escape Artist +4, Perception +7, Sense Motive +3, Stealth +10 (+18 in undergrowth)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "adaptation, tree meld Languages Sylvan (can't speak)", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +3, Will +2", "Melee": "2 claws +5 (1d4+2), bite +5 (1d6+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
