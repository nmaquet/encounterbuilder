The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the phantom stalker's last successful attack. Phantom stalkers can also ignite flammable materials with a touch. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Death Throes (Ex)</b> A phantom stalker reduced to 0 hit points or less expels a fiery blast equivalent to a <i>fireball</i> (caster level 6th) that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within 20 feet. A DC 15 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. A phantom stalker never uses this ability if it would harm the one that summoned it, unless the summoner itself is to blame for the phantom stalker's destruction (i.e., if the summoner attacks the stalker or orders it into battle against opponents that clearly outmatch it). </h5><h5><b>Find Target (Sp)</b> If the one who summoned the phantom stalker is slain while the stalker is on the Material Plane, the stalker can unerringly find the slayer as though guided by <i>discern location</i>. Once the slayer has been tracked and dealt with, the phantom stalker returns to its home plane. </h5><h5><b>Flames of Healing (Ex)</b> Any magical attack against a phantom stalker that deals fire damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the phantom stalker to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Phantom stalkers live in the Elemental Plane of Fire. In its true form, a phantom stalker appears as a column of fire. It can take a humanshaped form, appearing as a muscular, fiery red humanoid about 8 feet tall. A phantom stalker rarely enters the Material Plane on its own. If encountered, it is usually in the employ of a spellcaster that has summoned it there to do his bidding. A phantom stalker can be summoned using a <i>summon monster IV</i> spell.</p><p>A phantom stalker is 6 feet tall and weighs about 180 pounds.</p><p>A phantom stalker attacks with its claws, attempting to grab its opponent and pull it into its body.</p><p>Credit The Phantom Stalker originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Ian Livingstone.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Ignan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2928, "SubType": "(elemental, extraplanar, fire, shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 12, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Phantom Stalker", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +11, Perception +12, Survival +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Elemental Plane of Fire", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "find target, change shape 1/day (polymorph)", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +7, Will +2", "Melee": "2 burning claws +10 (1d4+4 plus 1d4 fire and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.
