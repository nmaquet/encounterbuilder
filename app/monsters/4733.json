Argosian cities and strongholds are constructed of stone and coral. The argos are a highly superstitious race, not really trusting arcane magic, but reveling in the miracles of divine magic and what it can do. Most argosian towns, cities, and strongholds have a temple at the center. Some have several temples; one larger one dedicated to the Drowning Lord and several smaller temples dedicated to the lesser aquatic deities. Rulers in argosian society are known as priest-kings, and all are mid- to high-level clerics. These individuals are revered by all argos and many consider them to be the living embodiment of their deity. To kill an argosian priest or priestess is punishable by death. In some argosian societies, even merely offending a priest or priestess brings swift and harsh punishment. The typical argos stand 6 feet tall and weigh just over 200 pounds. Its hide is scaly grayish-blue shading to light colors on its chest. A long dark gray fin runs from the crown of its head to its lower back. Its clawed hands and feet are both webbed, and its eyes are the color of soot. Females stand just less than 6 feet tall and are usually lighter in color. Argos mate once every few years generally, and gestation lasts about 6 months. Young are born live and are light gray in color, reaching maturity within 15 months. An argos typically lives to about 40 years of age. The typical argos diet consists of shark, small fish, seaweed and undersea plants and humanoid flesh. Argos are particularly fond of humans, elves, aquatic elves, and merfolk; the latter being considered a delicacy. Squid is never eaten by an argos; the animal being considered sacred and the favored animal of the Drowning Lord. In combat, an argos prefers to fight with a spear and its vicious bite. If disarmed or simply by choice, an argos can fight with its webbed claws to rend and slash its foes. When battling, an argos prefers to fight in the water where it has the advantage. Favored tactics include swooping down on prey from above or swimming up beneath prey and attacking from surprise. When attacking seaside towns civilizations, argos raiding bands attack at night and can number up to 80 individuals. They prefer to swarm their opponents and attack using their great numbers to overwhelm their opponents. They use the same general tactics when attacking seagoing vessels as well, swarming their targets and crushing them under the onslaught. Prisoners are rarely taken in such raids as most land-based life cannot breathe underwater or survive the memory-draining power of the River Styx. Some argosian cities do use magic however to sustain air breathing slaves and prisoners. These are rare, as most prisoners are slain and devoured within a few hours.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Argos, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "Solitary, pair, team (5-8), patrol (11-20 plus 1 lieutenant of 5th level), band (20-80 plus 100% noncombatants, 1 lieutenant of 5th level and 1 chieftain of 6th level per 20 adults), or tribe (70-160 plus 100% noncombatants, 1 lieutenant of 5th level per 20 adults, 1 chieftain of 6th level per 40 adults, 9 guards of 6th level, 1-4 water priestesses of 4th-7th level, 1 priestess of 8th level, 1 priest-king of 7th-9th level)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 14, Wis 13, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4733, "SubType": "(aquatic, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 11, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Argos", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Diplomacy +3, Intimidate +8, Knowledge (planes) +4, Perception +8, Stealth +8, Survival +8, Swim +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (River Styx)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +5", "Melee": "spear +7 (1d8+4), bite +2 (1d4+3) or 2 claws +7 (1d4+3), bite +7 (1d4+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
