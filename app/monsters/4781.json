For every point so drained, the devouring mist heals 5 hit points of damage. Creatures without blood take no damage from the devouring mist. </h5><h5><b>Create Spawn (Su)</b> Any creature slain by a devouring mist rises as a vampire spawn in 1d4 days, unless the remains are <i>blessed</i>. If the victim had more than 5 hit dice, there is a 1% chance per hit die that it arises as a full-fledged vampire instead, or a 5% chance per hit die if the victim was of the humanoid type.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Spawned of the dreams of the Bloodwraith, devouring mists are undead composed of equal parts blood and malice, wedded together by negative energy. They drift the halls of the Bloodways, looking for living prey to feed on and torment. When they strike, they surround their enemies and draw their blood from their bodies. Devouring mists are possessed of a malicious cunning. They are quite capable of blending into the mists of the Bloodways so as to take their prey unaware. They may also follow creatures for a time and attack when they are distracted or preoccupied. A devouring mist may even stalk its prey over hours or even days, striking again and again, in effect milking them of blood. Devouring mists do not speak, nor can they be communicated with.
