Its deep sky blue hooves do not touch the ground as it moves. The mane and tail of a dragon horse is of purest white and flows out behind it in an elegant cascade.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Dragon Horse</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 7</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>3,200</h5><h5>NG Large magical beast (air)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+7; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Perception +19</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>21, touch 13, flat-footed 18 (+3 Dex, +8 natural)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>76 (8d10+32)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+10, <b>Ref </b>+9, <b>Will </b>+8</h5><h5><b>SR </b>16</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>60 ft., fly 120 ft.

Being peaceful creatures, dragon horses dislike combat and seek to avoid it, unless pressed. In melee, a dragon horse attempts to deal nonlethal damage to its opponents. Unconscious opponents are not further attacked.</p><p>The name \"dragon horse\" is something of a misnomer, as these creatures have no relation to true dragons. They are, in fact, more closely related to the noble ki-rin. Dragon horses are creatures originally from the Elemental Plane of Air that have decided, for reasons unknown to anyone but themselves, to reside more or less permanently in the Material Plane.</p><p>Dragon horses visit the Elemental Plane of Air frequently, however.</p><p>Dragon horses are solitary creatures, but a mated pair will often remain together to raise their young. They have no need or desire for material possessions and so keep no treasure.</p><p>Training a Dragon Horse Dragon horses are highly prized as steeds, but they are notoriously difficult to train. They have a very free spirit and do not tolerate captivity, thus only juvenile dragon horses have any chance of being tamed mounts.</p><p>Dragon horse foals have the Young template, and mature to adult size after 10 years. A captive foal can be raised only by a good being and doing so requires 10 years and a Handle Animal check (DC 30) every 6 months.</p><p>Credit The Dragon Horse originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic, Auran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or family (2-3)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 17, Con 19, Int 16, Wis 18, Cha 20", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2538, "SubType": "(air)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "21, touch 13, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Dragon Horse", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +16, Knowledge (planes) +11, Perception +19, Sense Motive +12, Survival +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +9, Will +8", "Melee": "2 hooves +14 (1d6+7)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "60 ft., fly 120 ft.
