Coloration varies from brownish-green or brown to dark green mottled with brown splotches. Most weigh about 300 pounds.</p><p>They are found in all but the coldest of swamps and marshes and delight in attacking creatures that wander too close to their lair. Fungoids are carnivores and consider the flesh of humans, elves, and goblins a delicacy.</p><p>When food is scarce, fungoids become scavengers and feed on carrion.</p><p>Fungoids lair in the darkest and most dismal place they can find-the more devoid of light, the better. Typically a lair is ringed with mushrooms of varying colors, shapes and sizes. Such a telltale sign is often the only clue that a fungoid lair is present as the lair itself is normally well-hidden or camouflaged. Woe to a creature that actually wanders close enough to examine the mushrooms; by then the fungoids are likely aware of the interloper's presence and are biding their time before an all-out-attack.</p><p>Fungoids are nocturnal hunters and often travel up to 5 miles away from their lair in search of prey. Slain prey is carried or dragged back to the lair and devoured over several days time. Multiple fungoids are often encountered together on hunting excursions, but they never share their kill. \"Each to their own\" is the unspoken motto among fungoids.</p><p>Fungoids are straightforward combatants that rush into melee swinging their powerful fists. They pummel their foes relentlessly until they are destroyed or their adversaries are killed. Multiple fungoids sometimes work with one another to bring down powerful foes, but once the fight is over, the fungoids cooperation with one another ends, and it's every creature for itself when assessing and gathering up the kills. Fungoids never retreat and always fight to the death.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (understands but cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-4) or cluster (6-10)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+15)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2611, "SubType": "(fungus)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +8 Stealth in swampy or forested areas", "AC": "18, touch 11, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Fungoid", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +10, Stealth +6 (+14 in swampy or forested areas)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +2, Will +1", "Melee": "2 slams +8 (1d8+4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
