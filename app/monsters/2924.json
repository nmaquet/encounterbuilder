They shoot first and eat later.</p><p>Greenskins are a wicked orcish species of arboreal hunters. More stealthy and agile than their common cousins they are slighter of build but suffer no penalties from daylight or bright light. They are generally open and friendly to other evil humanoid races and often set up trade routes with said creatures. They make their homes among the dense foliage of the forest building their wooden huts from the trees and branches. Some tribes even build their entire village among the treetops (as a defense measure against land-based adversaries). Greenskin orcs stand about 6 feet tall. Females are slightly smaller. Hair color is always black or greenish-black. Eye color varies, but is usually dark brown, dark green, or occasionally deep, rich blue.</p><p>Greenskins are highly proficient in the use stealth and surprise, attacking with their ranged weapons when an enemy is sighted. They seek to disable and weaken foes with arrows before closing to finish the job with their wicked longswords.<b></p><p>Greenskin Orc Society</b></p><p> Greenskins tend to get along well with most other species of orcs being smart enough to take orders and wise enough to keep their mouths shut. They often serve roles in mixed tribes as scouts and skirmishers.</p><p>Greenskins are mortal enemies of elves and the bane of fey and enchanted woodland creatures. They torture such beings mercilessly should they manage to take one alive. Despite their skill with the longbow, greenskin warriors are equally proficient with the longsword and hunting knife.</p><p>Greenskins tend to hunt in packs, using their scent ability to track their quarry. Their hunting packs are competitive with one another, each member seeking to be the one to make the kill. Greenskins are likely to have 1d2 trained worgs among them. Greenskin lairs often have as many as two dozen of these foul creatures living and sleeping amongst their masters filthy sleeping rags.</p><p>Greenskin tribes are known to hire themselves out to civilized masters as scouts and even irregular and regular missile units. They are also likely to serve evil druids and despotic ranger lords.</p><p><br><b>Greenskin Orc Characters</b><br> Greenskin leaders tend to be rangers or druids.
