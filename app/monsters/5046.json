Scholars speculate an entire plane (a para-elemental plane of cold or ice) exists where the Plane of Air and Plane of Water meet. There, the great ice salamanders make their homes carved into great icebergs or upon vast sheets of ice. Upon their home plane, the ice salamanders gather in large, loose tribes, led by the strongest member of the group. Infighting is common among tribal members and should a dispute escalate, it is usually settled in a makeshift arena where all participants fight to the death. When summoned to the Material Plane ice salamanders can be found in arctic regions where the temperatures are constantly freezing or lower (which to an ice salamander is still too warm). On the Material Plane, ice salamanders are often found acting as guards for high-level wizards or temple guardians for clerics of the frost gods. Some ice salamanders find their way to the Material Plane on their own, in areas where the elemental planes have spilled over to the Material Plane. An ice salamander stands about 6 feet tall with a serpentine head and the lower torso of a salamander. Its scales are blue mottled white, and its underbelly is stark white. Its eyes are ice blue and its pupils are dark. Cold seems to emanate from the creature at all times. Ice salamanders jump headlong into melee, slashing their opponents with their wicked spears or claws. Prisoners are rarely taken, unless the ice salamanders are instructed to do so. Most of the time, prey is devoured as soon as it's killed.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, gang (3-5)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+21)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 12, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5046, "SubType": "(air, cold, extraplanar, water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (spear)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 11, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ice Salamander", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +11, Intimidate +11, Knowledge (planes) +11, Perception +12, Sense Motive +12, Stealth +11, Survival +12", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Water)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "snow move, snow vision", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +6, Will +4", "Melee": "spear +11/+6 (1d8+4/x3 plus 1d6 cold) or 2 claws +10 (1d6+3 plus 1d6 cold)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., burrow 20 ft.
