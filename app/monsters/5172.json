While not wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks. </h5><h5><b>Noxious Breath (Su)</b> Three times per day, as a standard action a magaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same magaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Shared Senses (Su)</b> All magaavs within 100 feet of one another share the same senses. Thus, if one individual perceives something (for example, with a successful Perception check), all others within range are immediately aware of it. Senses are instantly relayed from one magaav to the next, allowing for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread through and inform an entire swarm instantly. It is still possible for a magaav to be flat-footed for other reasons even if other magaavs nearby are not.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Hunters of souls, host devils retrieve Hell's most elusive property. Whether souls that have long evaded capture upon the plains of Avernus, damned beings who have somehow managed to escape Hell, or creatures that have reneged upon infernal contracts, vast flocks of these winged fiends fly from the Pit to recover their prey. Rarely seen alone, host devils travel in great swarms that often number in the thousands. These four-winged mockeries of the angelic form swarm in enormous columns, moving in tandem as though they were one colossal, infernal beast controlled by a single brain. Magaavs stand 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds, with wingspans reaching 10 feet across. Their fetid breath draws flies that swarm over their bodies.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Celestial, Draconic, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or flock (2-6)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+21)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 19, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5172, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Hover, Mobility", "AlternateNameForm": "Magaav", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 15, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Host Devil", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +14 (+10 when jumping), Escape Artist +14, Fly +14, Intimidate +10, Perception +11, Stealth +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Hell)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "master grappler, shared senses", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +9, Will +3", "Melee": "mwk ranseur +12/+7 (2d4+6/x3) or 2 claws +11 (1d6+4 plus 2 bleed)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., fly 50 ft.
