Any creature that comes within that area must succeed on DC 19 Fortitude save or become nauseated for as long as they remain within the area a 1 minute after leaving the area. A creature that makes a successful save is immune to the nauseating aura of that rawbones for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Strangulation (Ex)</b> When a rawbones hits an opponent of up to one size larger with its entrails lash, it can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it succeeds on its grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage per round in addition to normal damage to the grappled opponent each round that the hold is maintained. </h5><h5><b>Vomit Gore (Su)</b> Three times per day, a rawbones can spit a blast of blood and gore in a 20-foot cone that deals 7d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half). The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A rawbones is an undead creature that comes into being when a tortured person rises from the grave. Rawbones are commonly found in ancient dungeons that hold old torture chambers and prison cells. Some are also found haunting the local cemeteries where a tortured person was laid to rest. While disgusting in appearance, there is something in the magic (or evil) of a rawbones that keeps it looking \u2018fresher' that most of its other undead kin.</p><p>Like many undead, rawbones despise the living and seek to harm such creatures whenever they can. A rawbones is generally a solitary creature though it is possible more than one could be encountered together (e.g., an ancient dungeon where a mass torture/execution took place or a mass grave where tortured and broken bodies where laid to rest).</p><p>A rawbones stands 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs roughly 140 pounds.</p><p>Its bones are stained red with fresh blood which seems to continually weep from the creature's body. Bits of flesh and muscle fall away from it as it moves about and its entrails often drag the ground behind it or are wrapped around the creature's forearms.</p><p>A rawbones speaks Common and at least one other language.</p><p>A rawbones attacks primarily with its powerful fists, but it has other weapons at its disposal. It can vomit forth a horrifying spray of blood and gore or use its entrails as a ranged weapon which it loops around an opponent's neck in an attempt to strangle it. While battling its foes, it attempts to keep them within range of its nauseating aura.</p><p>A rawbones' natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Infernal", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(14d8+28)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 14, Con -, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.
