A successful critical hit causes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1 point of Constitution drain (instead of double Constitution damage). With each successful attack, a necro-phantom gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Resist the Grave (Ex)</b> A necro-phantom gains a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities from the school of Necromancy. </h5><h5><b>Sense Necromancy (Su)</b> A necro-phantom can attempt a Spellcraft check to identify a spell being cast within a 60- foot radius (DC 15 + spell level). The necro-phantom gains a +4 racial bonus on its check if the spell is from the school of Necromancy.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A creature that dies (either of its own accord or one that is killed) in an area poisoned by necromantic magic sometimes returns to the land of the living as a necro-phantom, an evil undead creature with a hatred for all things living, especially those who dabble in necromancy. Necro-phantoms are found haunting cemeteries, temples, mausoleums, and any other place necromantic magic is or was once prevalent. Often more than one necro-phantom is encountered; some strange effect of the magic that created them seems to draw these creatures to one another. A necro-phantom appears as a rotting desiccated corpse still dressed in the clothing it wore in life (though it is now tattered and worn). Its nails are filthy and long and its teeth are broken. Each necro-phantom varies in height from 5 feet to almost 7 feet tall and weighs anywhere from 100 pounds to over 200 pounds. Necro-phantoms can speak Common, but seldom bother unless they are cursing a necromancy-wielding opponent. Necro-phantoms attack their opponents by raking and slashing with their claws. A necro-phantom engaged in battle with a spellcaster uses its sense magic ability to attempt to identify any spell being cast. If it detects a necromancy spell, it focuses its attention on that spellcaster, ignoring all other opponents until the necromancy-wielding caster flees or is dead. If one necro-phantom out of a group successfully identifies a necromancy spell, it signals to the others of its kind and all move to attack the spellcaster.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 13, Con -, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5017, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Necro-Phantom", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +8, Intimidate +9, Perception +11, Spellcraft +5, Stealth +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +2, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +7 (1d6+3 plus 1d4 Con damage), bite +6 (1d6+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
