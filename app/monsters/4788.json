Most inhabit forests and plains, though some often roam more rugged territory. Dire stags are aggressive giant versions of male deer. Dire stag are nocturnal creatures and exist on a diet of leaves, vines, ivy, and meat, the latter consisting of rodents and small animals (rabbits, moles, pigs, and wolves). A typical male's territory covers a range of 5 square miles. Dire stags mark territorial boundaries by digging holes with their antlers. Such holes can measure up to 6 feet wide and 3 feet deep. They often thrash the ground throughout their territory, stirring up the leaves and underbrush, to further define their territory. Dire stags are solitary creatures, but sometimes band together, usually during mating or rutting season. During rutting season, a dire stag gathers up to 12 female deer in its territory. Mating season is usually late fall and gestation typically lasts 8 months. Newborn are nursed by the females and are dependent on their mother for the first few months of their lives. Young are slowly weaned over a period of 6 months and reach maturity by 18 months. A dire stag stands 6 feet at the shoulder and about 12 feet long with its weight exceeding 1,000 pounds. Its antlers average up to 8 feet wide, though some of the largest dire stag have antlers reaching up to 12 feet wide. Its coat varies in color from brown to brownish-white to black, with its underbelly being lighter, and usually white. Its antlers are brown or black. Dire stags are hunted for their meat as well as their tough hides. A reasonably intact dire stag hide is worth 500 gp or more. Dire stags are aggressive animals and rarely back down from a challenge. They unleash a guttural, blood-curdling bleat before attacking. This serves to warn the females and young as well as potential aggressors. Dire stags almost never retreat, preferring to fight to the death against a foe. A dire stag attacks with its antlers, goring its opponent, or it rears onto its hind legs and slashes with its hooves. Most dire stags fight to the death to protect their young.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or herd (10-50 deer plus 1 dire stag per 10 deer)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d8+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4788, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Lightning Reflexes, MultiattackB, Run", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception, +4 Stealth", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Dire Stag", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Perception +12, Stealth +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold or temperate forests and plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +9, Will +3", "Melee": "gore +7 (1d8+5), 2 hooves +5 (1d6+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
