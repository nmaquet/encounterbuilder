Floating eyes are most often found underground in forgotten dungeon waterways and underground lakes and seas. The creature's eye is capable of bioluminescence, and it has such minute control over the intensity and patterns of the light that it can mesmerize other creatures that see it. Floating eyes are part of an unusual symbiotic relationship with a variety of predatory fish, including sharks. Once the floating eye has mesmerized its prey, predatory fish move in and consume it. After they have eaten, the floating eye moves in and gorges itself on the scraps.</p><p>Floating eyes avoid combat, relying on their <i>hypnotic gaze</i> ability. If forced into combat, they bite an opponent.</p><p>Credit The Floating Eye originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "school (3-12)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 1, Dex 15, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 4, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2601, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 on Stealth checks to hide", "AC": "16, touch 12, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Floating Eye", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +4, Stealth +14 (+22 to hide), Swim +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "-3", "Race": "", "CR": "1/3", "XP": 135, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +4, Will -3", "Melee": "bite +0 (1d2-5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Diminutive"}
