The blood becomes inert one round after leaving the elemental's body. </h5><h5><b>Radial Symmetry (Ex)</b> Because of its shape, the stone treant can bring no more than four of its slam attacks to bear on any one target. However, it also perceives the area around it equally well, and thus it cannot be flanked.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The stone treant is a variant of the treant native to the Plane of Earth. They are very rare even there, located in isolated pockets in the plane where they tend groves of crystals and natural gem outcroppings. Knowledge of their existence has been all but lost, as has the ritual of summoning and binding them into service. A stone treant stands 20-30 ft. tall, with a trunk about 4 ft. in diameter. It weighs close to 10,000 pounds. Stone treants are intelligent, and speak Terran. They generally do not bother to communicate with non-earth elemental beings, however.
