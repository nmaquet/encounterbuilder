Legends and stories told by the various rulers of Hell say he is in fact the first pit fiend; the one from which all others were spawned. Alastor has always existed as far as the arch-devils know; none can remember a time before he was there.</p><p>Though stories say he was thrown down from Heaven when Lucifer and his court were cast down, Lucifer himself has denied such tales.</p><p>Alastor serves as Hell's Executioner. He makes his lair deep within the confines of Asmodeus's palace on the nethermost circle of Hell. He is loyal to none but Asmodeus, and his loyalty has never been in question. Those who have questioned his loyalty to Hell's arch ruler usually find themselves on the wrong end of his axe.</p><p>Alastor takes great pride in his job and his blade never falters. When tasked with the execution of a traitor, prisoner, or simply someone Asmodeus has grown weary of, Alastor does the job, neat and clean every time. A mortal killed by his hands finds Hell to be a rather pleasant place compared to the eternal torture most endure once they fall to Alastor's axe.</p><p>Alastor resembles a pit fiend in appearance and stands 16 feet tall. He weighs roughly 1,000 pounds.</p><p>Alastor rarely engages in combat; not because he cannot, but because most such encounters are trivial to him and he becomes bored with it very easily. If pressed into battle, he uses his <i><i>power word</i> kill</i> ability immediately against his closest opponent. Next, he unleashes a <i>meteor storm</i>, followed by a <i>fireball</i>, before finishing his spell-like abilities with a <i>mass hold monster</i> against as many foes as possible. Next he wades into battle with Grimfang and his array of natural attacks. When he finally becomes bored with the battle, he seeks to quickly end it by calling in other devils to finish off any remaining opponents. Should Alastor be in danger at any time, he uses his <i>greater teleport</i> to escape, remembering his foes for a later time, which he will invariably hunt down with a retinue of pit fiends and kill.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Celestial, Draconic, Giant, Ignan, Infernal, Terran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or retinue (Alastor plus 1d2 pit fiends)", "Ref": "32", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(40d10+440)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 43, Dex 27, Con 33, Int 28, Wis 30, Cha 26", "Gear": "Grimfang", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2479, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Awesome Blow, Bleeding Critical, Cleave, Critical Focus, Diehard, Endurance, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical (battleaxe), Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Multiattack, Persuasive, Power Attack, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (power word stun), Quicken Spell-Like Ability (fireball), Weapon Focus (battleaxe)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "26", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "48, touch 25, flat-footed 40", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Alastor", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +51, Bluff +51, Diplomacy +55, Disguise +51, Fly +49, Intimidate +55, Knowledge (arcana) +49, Knowledge (local) +49, Knowledge (planes) +52, Knowledge (religion) +49, Perception +57, Sense Motive +57, Spellcraft +49, Stealth +47, Survival +50", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "34", "Race": "", "CR": "25", "XP": 820000, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Hell)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +26, Ref +32, Will +34", "Melee": "+3 unholy vorpal battleaxe +59/+54/+49/+44 (2d6+19/19-20/x3) or 2 claws +55 (2d6+16), bite +55 (4d6+16 plus poison and disease), 2 wings +53 (2d6+16), tail slap +53 (2d8+24 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., fly 60 ft.
