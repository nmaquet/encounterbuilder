This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 6d6 points of acid damage (DC 17 Reflex half) to all creatures in a 20-foot radius spread. Additionally, a creature that fails its save takes 3d6 points of acid damage one round after failing its save. Once a vile drake has used its acid breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Disease (Su)</b> <i>Marsh Sickness</i>: Bite-injury; save DC 17 Fort; <i>onset</i> 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Int damage. A creature whose Int score drops below 12 as a result of marsh sickness acts as if affected by a <i>confusion</i> spell (CL 9th) until the disease is cured; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Savage Bite (Ex)</b> A vile drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. </h5><h5><b>Speed Surge (Ex)</b> Three times per day as a swift action, a vile drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round. </h5><h5><b>Swamp Stride (Ex)</b> A vile drake can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. </h5><h5><b>Water Breathing (Ex)</b> A vile drake can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its acid breath and other abilities while submerged.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Vile drakes prey upon those creatures unlucky enough to find themselves caught in the drake's territory. Travelers, fishermen, crocodiles, lizardfolk, and chikes (see their entry in this book) are the usual victims and subsequent meals of vile drakes. Prey that is not devoured immediately is carried back to their swampy lairs and stored under the muck and mud for later consumption. Vile drakes are about 9 feet long and weigh close to 800 pounds. Their scales are usually black or dark gray, with lighter colors present on their undersides. Eyes are always dark in color. Vile drakes mate for life with the female laying a clutch of up to five eggs once per year. Eggs are laid in the mud and buried to hide them from predators and poachers. Eggs hatch within 9 months. Young reach maturity rapidly, usually within 3 years. Vile drakes, on average, live up to 200 years. Vile drakes often stalk their prey for miles before attacking. They are generally pack hunters and so encounters with a solitary vile drake are rare. When they spring to attack, vile drakes open with their breath weapon, and then rush in to bite with their nasty fangs.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or wing (3-8)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d12+36)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 14, Con 18, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4806, "SubType": "(water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 11, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Vile Drake", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +12, Intimidate +13, Perception +15, Stealth +10, Survival +7, Swim +21", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "speed surge, swamp stride, water breathing", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +10, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +13 (2d6+5/19-20 plus disease), 2 claws +13 (1d6+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 50 ft.
