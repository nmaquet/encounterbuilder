The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> A fire elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A cold effect <i>slow</i>s a fire elemental construct (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds with no saving throw. This is in addition to any damage it takes because of its vulnerability to cold. A <i>quench</i> spell negates the fire elemental construct's damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 round. Any water-based spell of 5th level or higher deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the fire elemental construct. The construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level + caster's relevant ability score modifier) to half the damage. Any fire-based spell or effect heals 1 point of damage on the fire elemental construct for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Fire elemental constructs are perhaps the rarest of the elemental constructs (perhaps because their very makeup poses a danger to many spellcasters). Favored by efreeti sorcerers and salamander wizards, these constructs are often found guarding an ancient efreeti treasure cache or hoard.</p><p>A fire elemental construct is a humanoid, 9 feet tall, composed of yellow-orange fire and flame. Its face lacks any discernable features, though sometimes, two pinpoints of white-hot fire seem to appear on its head, perhaps functioning as eyes. Its arms and legs end in tormented elemental faces, each howling and screaming (in an indecipherable tongue) at its imprisonment.</p><p>A fire elemental construct batters and pummels its foes with its flaming fists. Occasionally, the elemental grapples a foe and pulls it into its burning form.</p><p>Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like any other automaton follows any order or command given to it to the best of its ability.</p><p>An elemental construct's creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct's creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the elemental construct under someone else's control, and so on), but the elemental construct's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone.</p><p>Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is composed entirely of its native element.</p><p>Construction An elemental construct's body is formed completely of one of the four elements air, earth, fire, or water. The materials must be the finest quality or purest form taken from the respective plane and mixed with rare oils, powders, and other ingredients totaling 5,000 gp.</p><p></h5><h5><b>ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCT CL </b>17th; </h5><h5><b>Price </b>200,000 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct (see the Bestiary), <i>geas/ quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, two spells of 4th level or higher with the appropriate elemental descriptor, creator must be caster level 17th; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Craft (sculptures) DC 20; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>102,500 gp Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "19", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(30d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 27, Dex 29, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2576, "SubType": "(elemental, fire, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "28, touch 17, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Fire Elemental Construct", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "13", "XP": 25600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Plane of Fire", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +19, Will +10", "Melee": "2 slams +36 (2d6+8 plus burn)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "60 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
