This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted. </h5><h5><b>Lifesense (Su)</b> An ekimmu notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. </h5><h5><b>Malevolence (Su)</b> The ekimmu's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ekimmu can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a <i>magic jar</i> spell (CL 8th), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ekimmu must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 21 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ekimmu's malevolence for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the ekimmu's Ability Focus feat. </h5><h5><b>Paralyzing Howl (Su)</b> At will, an ekimmu can let out a fearsome howl that paralyzes all within a 30 feet radius for 1d4+1 rounds unless they succeed on a DC 19 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that ekimmu's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> In most cases, it's difficult to destroy an ekimmu through simple combat: the \"destroyed\" spirit restores itself in 2d6 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy an ekimmu is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from entering the underworld. </h5><h5><b>Unnatural Aura (Su)</b> Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of an ekimmu, unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>An ekimmu is the evil ghost of one who has been denied entrance to the underworld and is doomed to wander the earth. It is greatly feared, for it attaches itself quite easily to virtually any living person regardless of whether that person has been acquainted with the dead one. Once it has possessed a living host, it is very difficult to exorcise. An ekimmu roams the lands near where it was killed. Though it is not bound to the area, it feels a sense of connection to it and rarely wanders more than a few miles from it. An ekimmu has no permanent lair and wanders its realm perpetually, always on the move. An ekimmu roams the earth, seeking victims to possess and using its hosts to bring misfortune and death to the living. Its howling in the night is often the only warning of its approach. In battle, it uses its array of abilities to defeat and destroy its opponents, opening combat with its paralyzing howl and then using its malevolence to attack a target it deems weak-willed and open for possession.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d8+40 plus 8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 16, Con -, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 21", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4815, "SubType": "(incorporeal)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (malevolence)B, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 19, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ekimmu", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +22, Intimidate +16, Knowledge (local) +10, Perception +13, Sense Motive +13, Stealth +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +5, Will +10", "Melee": "incorporeal touch +9 (7d6, DC 19 Fort half)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 30 ft.
