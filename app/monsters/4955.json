If the opponent or the coral giant is touching the ground, the coral giant takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the coral giant is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. </h5><h5><b>Water Stride (Ex)</b> A coral giant suffers no penalties for fighting in or under water (as if affected by a <i>freedom of movement</i> spell).</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Coral giants are 12-foot tall humanoids that dwell beneath the waves. They make their homes in great undersea castles constructed of stone. They are generally peaceful creatures and spend their days fishing and tending to their coral farms. Their diet typically consists of undersea plants, fish, and the like, with occasional forays onto land to hunt large game. Trade with other intelligent races is common, with coral giant jewelry being prized by many races. These creatures are on generally good terms with merfolk, tritons, storm giants, and humans. Wars are waged against the sahuagin, krakens, and aboleths, the latter being a particularly hated foe. Coral giant homes are most always constructed of smooth stone and contain large, open expanses and rooms. Their homes usually contain a few rooms constructed for air-breathers so land-based visitors can move about somewhat freely. Homes are deep under the waters, but no so deep as to be inaccessible to other races looking to trade and bargain. Though coral giants can survive in any waters, they prefer temperate or warm environments to cold temperatures. They can also freely breathe air, but prefer life underwater to land. Coral giants are, on average, 12 feet tall and weigh 1,500 pounds. Females tend to be slightly smaller and lighter than males. Skin tones vary in color but are always some shade of coral. Hair color varies from deep blacks to light reds. On very rare occasions, a coral giant is encountered that has white hair. Coral giant's eyes are usually dark blue or green. They can live to be 400 years old. Coral giant leaders are typically fighters or barbarians, though a few are rangers. Druids and clerics are common among coral giants; other spellcasting classes are not. Coral giants fight with massive tridents in combat, fiercely protecting their territory and young. Creatures not driven off are slaughtered and left for scavenging fish to feed upon.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), hunting party (6-9), or clan (10-20 plus 1 fighter chief of 5th level, and 11-20 sharks)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(13d8+65)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 25, Dex 14, Con 21, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rock +11 (1d8+10)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4955, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Dodge, Intimidating Prowess, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (trident)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "13", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 12, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Coral Giant", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Craft (jewelry) +9, Intimidate +14, Perception +13, Sense Motive +3, Survival +10, Swim +21", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious, water stride", "Saves": "Fort +13, Ref +6, Will +5", "Melee": "mwk trident +17/+12 (2d6+10) or 2 slams +15 (1d8+7)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Large"}
