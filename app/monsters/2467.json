Creatures attacking Tsathogga unarmed or with natural weapons take 2d8 points of acid damage each time one of their attacks hits. Any weapon striking Tsathogga's acidic body likewise takes acid damage. </h5><h5><b>Blasphemous Croak (Su)</b> Three times per day, Tsathogga can unleash a piercing croak that affects all non-evil creatures within a 100-foot radius as if by a <i>blasphemy</i> spell (CL 20th). There is no save against the effects. </h5><h5><b>Seeping Darkness (Su)</b> As a free action, Tsathogga can billow forth a cloud of thick, dark fog from his skin. This fog spreads to fill a 50-foot radius, 50 feet high. The darkness generated by the cloud nullifies nonmagical lights and magical lights of 5th level or lower within the area. Furthermore, all creatures in the area gain concealment, including those that can normally see in such darkness, tough Tsathogga is able to see normally in it. Light descriptor spells of 5th level or lower (such as <i>daylight</i>, <i>dancing lights</i>, and light) are incapable of brightening the area. This cloud remains for 10 minutes before dispersing. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round. Tsathogga cannot use this ability underwater. Once the cloud disperses, Tsathogga can issue a new one if he desires.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>This foul frog-demon cares less about the machinations of men and power than he does about obliterating light and life with the slow oozing sickness and decay that he represents. He is the viscous dark evil bubbling up from beneath the surface, the foul corruption at the heart of the earth.</p><p>Tsathogga makes his home on both Tarterus and the Abyss, spending equal amounts of time in both places. His lair is a vast swamp of filth deposited by the River Styx as it flows between the two planes.</p><p>Tsathogga's main form is of a colossally-bloated humanoid frog with spindly, elongated limbs and fingers. His corpulent body exudes all manner of foul oils and fluids, which leak into the vile swamp in which he lies. He has positioned himself so that all of the slime and filth from the River Styx feeds into his gaping, toothy maw. He rarely moves and rarely speaks other than to emit an unintelligible shrieking. Tsathogga thoughtlessly commands a host of evil creatures, notably his own vile frog race, the tsathar (see that entry in this book).</p><p>Tsathogga is 60 feet long and 40 feet tall. He weighs about 200 tons.</p><p>Tsathogga prefers to avoid direct combat simply because he usually has better things to do than waste time killing the latest group of would-be demon killers. If threatened or attacked, he usually summons his minions to battle his opponents. If Tsathogga does enter combat, he almost always begins by striking the nearest opponent with his tongue, pulling that foe in and swallowing him. If he is near the muck and filth that permeates his home plane, he likes to dive or bury himself underneath it so if a swallowed opponent does manage to cut his way out of Tsathogga's gullet, he usually drowns or suffocates before he sees <i>daylight</i> again.</p><p>Servants of Tsathogga Followers of Tsathogga are the tsathar and some few evil and vile humans or giants. He has few other worshippers, though it is rumored that an evil cult of sahuagin worships him on the Material Plane. Devout followers of Tsathogga are called Lords of the Gaping Maw and must sign a pact of evil with Tsathogga. Lords of the Gaping Maw receive spells from Tsathogga and are granted access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Water.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Bill Webb.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Abyssal, Common, Giant, Infernal, Terran; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or troupe (Tsathogga plus 1-2 nalfeshnees, 1-4 greruors, and 4-12 abyssal dire frogs)", "Ref": "18", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(42d10+630)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 41, Dex 18, Con 40, Int 23, Wis 22, Cha 24", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "tongue +39 (grab plus 2d8 acid)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "20 ft.
