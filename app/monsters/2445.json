They spend most of their time flying high above the Abyssal planes scouring the lands for food or patrolling a demon lord's domain if they are in the service of such a demon. When serving under a demon lord or one of his generals, mezzalorns are often utilized as shock troops or first-assault troops in war.</p><p>Mezzalorns are thoroughly evil and despise all non-demons, attacking them on sight. Slain creatures are carried back to their lair and distributed among the inhabitants of the nest. Among demonkind they despise stirge demons with an unbridled hatred and always attack them on sight, fighting to the death when battling them. Slain stirge demons are not eaten by wasp demons (they dislike their smell, and as such dislike their taste even more), but are completely and utterly destroyed, their bodies being torn to pieces or injected with so much venom as to liquefy their internals.</p><p>A mezzalorn makes its lair in rocky outcroppings or in underground burrows and tunnels on the various abyssal planes. They generally avoid the less hospitable planes composed of acids, oozes, slimes, waters, or vapors as they require a solid surface on which to build their nests. A nest is composed of just about anything a mezzalorn can find and carry: bones, debris, refuse, weapons, and so on.</p><p>A mezzalorn stands as tall as a human and is about 10 feet long. Its body is dark with red bands and ends in a golden stinger. Its legs resemble those of a giant wasp and are covered in fine hairs and bristles. Its human-like visage is copper and sports matted dark hair. Its horns are black.</p><p>Mezzalorn tactics are simple and straightforward: fly into battle, sting a foe repeatedly until it dies. Often a mezzalorn grabs a foe, flies upward away from the opponent's allies, and stings its grappled victim until it dies, dropping the carcass without thought or care before wading back into the battle. Mezzalorn's hate stirge demons and fly demons and attack them on sight.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, cluster (2-4), or nest (5-10)", "Ref": "15", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+72)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 21, Con 23, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2445, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (poison), Blind-Fight, Cleave, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "27, touch 14, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mezzalorn Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +17, Escape Artist +20, Fly +11, Intimidate +18, Knowledge (planes) +16, Perception +18, Stealth +16, Survival +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "pheromones", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +15, Will +7", "Melee": "sting +16 (2d6+4 plus poison), 2 claws +16 (1d6+4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., fly 50 ft.
