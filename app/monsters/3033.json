They are voracious creatures and spend a good part of their day hunting food. A squealer attacks using its bite and claws. One of its favorite tactics is to hide in a tree, grasping a limb with three of its claws. When prey passes beneath, it swings down to attack. If it can grapple its prey, it drops from the tree, raking with its hind legs.</p><p>Squealers communicate with others of their kind using a series of grunts, growls, and squeals. They cannot speak any known language. A typical squealer stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 400 pounds.</p><p>Credit The Squealer originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1980) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(12d10+48)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 15, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3033, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Critical Focus, Improved Critical (claw), Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "Stealth +12 in forests", "AC": "17, touch 11, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Squealer", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +8, Climb +20, Perception +10, Stealth +4 (+16 in forests)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "sound imitation", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +10, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +17 (1d6+6/19-20), bite +17 (1d8+6 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
