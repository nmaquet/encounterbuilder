The bolt has a range of 40 feet and deals 6d6 points of fire damage against a single target (Reflex save DC 14 for half). This is a function of the amber skeleton and not the spear itself. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Heated Body (Ex)</b> Any creature striking an amber skeleton unarmed or with natural weapons takes 2d6 points of fire damage (no save). Weapons striking an amber skeleton take this same fire damage unless the attacker succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save. Damage caused to weapons in this manner is not halved, but hardness does prevent some of the damage dealt. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> An amber skeleton is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted: A magical attack that deals fire damage heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the amber skeleton to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. An amber skeleton gets no saving throw against fire effects. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Water (Ex)</b> A significant amount of water, such as that created by a <i>create water</i> spell, the contents of a large bucket, or a blow from a water elemental, that strikes an amber skeleton forces the creature to make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 2d4 rounds. An amber skeleton that is immersed in water must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (the DC increases by +1 each subsequent round) or take 1d6 points of damage each round until the water is gone.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p><i>Amber skeletons are constructed and used by high level spellcasters</i>, <i>often acting as guardians to keep secret some unknown or lost knowledge</i>. <i>An amber skeleton appears as an amber-colored skeleton</i>, <i>about 7 feet tall</i>, <i>with two large gemstones that function as eyes</i>. <i>It is often mistaken for an undead creature</i>. <i>The gemstones can be pried out of a destroyed amber skeleton with a</i> <i>DC 20 Strength check</i>.
