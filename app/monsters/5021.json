They are about the same size as warhorses, but have leaner musculature and long, flowing manes and tails. Noble steeds are incredibly fast, and can even run on air. In the wild, noble steeds can often be found associating with normal horses and pegasuses. Adult wild noble steeds are incapable of being tamed; these animals must be raised as foals in captivity if they are to be tamed. Domesticated adult noble steeds can cost as much as 800 gp when they can be found. Noble steed foals cost around 400 gp. Noble steeds can vary in color just as standard horses do. Most tend toward lighter shades however, with slightly darker manes and tails. Noble steeds can breed with normal horses. The offspring however is always a normal horse. Only the mating of two noble steeds produces another noble steed. Noble steeds can live up to 50-60 years. Noble steeds are generally docile and avoid combat if possible. If the family or herd is threatened however, the males move to attack while females move to protect the young. Much like their mundane counterparts, noble steeds attack with a combination of hooves and biting. If combat goes against them, noble steeds can usually outrun their foes or can take to the air and flee.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Auran (can't speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, mated pair, family (solitary mare plus 1-3 foals), or herd (5-20)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+25)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 18, Con 21, Int 4, Wis 17, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5021, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Endurance, Run B, Skill Focus (Fly), Weapon Focus (hoof)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 13, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Noble Steed", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +17, Perception +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +8, Will +4", "Melee": "2 hooves +10 (1d6+5), bite +9 (1d4+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "70 ft., fly 70 ft.
