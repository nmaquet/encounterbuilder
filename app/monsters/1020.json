Freeing a stuck weapon from an adherer requires a successful grapple check. If the adherer moves away, the wielder must release the weapon or make a successful grapple check to hold onto it; otherwise, the weapon is pulled from the wielder's grasp (a locked gauntlet gives the wielder a +10 bonus on this check). Striking an adherer with natural weapons or unarmed attacks allows the adherer to immediately attempt to grab the attacker. Up to four Medium or smaller creatures can become stuck to a single adherer. Adherers do not gain the grappled condition when creatures are stuck to them. An adherer can use its grab ability on creatures up to one size category larger than itself. Its adhesive has no effect on stone. Throwing boiling water on an adherer or dealing at least 10 points of fire damage to it reduces the save DC and grapple CMD of the adherence ability by -4 for 1 minute. <i>Universal solvent</i> and alchemical solvent weaken the filaments, freeing everything stuck to the adherer and preventing it from using its adherence ability for 1 hour. The strands lose their stickiness 1 hour after the adherer dies. An adherer can release anything stuck to it as a free action. The save DC for this ability is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Adherers look vaguely like embalmed and mummified corpses wrapped in dirty linen, but are in fact something else entirely. Transformed by hideous processes on the Ethereal Plane, their bodies are riddled with tiny, adhesive strands that can stick to anything, allowing the adherers to bind their enemies' weapons and capture living creatures for their depraved, blood-draining rituals. Though once human, adherers have forgotten all traces of humanity, and now hunt their former kindred with gleeful abandon.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo", "Source": "Misfit Monsters", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), or nest (6-12)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(4d10+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 16, Con 15, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1020, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Agile Maneuvers, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+2 Craft (cloth), +4 Stealth", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Adherer", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +10, Craft (traps) +3, Craft (cloth) +5, Perception +5, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any temperate or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "adherence", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +7, Will +5", "Melee": "2 slams +7 (1d6+3 plus adherence and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 10 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Medium"}
