Each slam attack deals 1d6 additional acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature touched by a lightning bladder takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes the creature takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The bladder's touch deals 12 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the bladder must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Electrical Discharge (Ex)</b> Any hit scored against a lightning bladder with a piercing or slashing weapon opens a hole in the creature's acidic membrane, through which lightning-like charges of electricity will blast out each subsequent combat round. These bolts of lightning inflict 2d6 points of damage against a randomly determined opponent (DC 15 Reflex save for half damage). The bladder can have any number of such openings before it is eventually killed from the damage.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Lightning bladders are a form of ooze, contained within a thin, membranous skin; they resemble massive, half-filled blue water balloons some 5-6 feet in diameter. The inside of the creature is charged with immense electrical potential, clearly visible as lightning-like flashes and forks within the bluish-hued interior of the shapeless mass. The exterior membrane is highly acidic, and the creature will attack by slumping up against its opponents to slam them. The more dangerous aspect of a lightning bladder, however, is what happens when a pointed or cutting weapon pierces its outer membrane, releasing the inner electrical charge.
