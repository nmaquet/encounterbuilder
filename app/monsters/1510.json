While in this state, the charau-ka automatically fails Stealth checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal components (or use items that require command words to activate), but functions as if under the effects of a <i>haste</i> spell. The charauka can continue shrieking for up to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round. </h5><h5><b>Thrown-Weapon Mastery (Ex</b>) Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka gain Throw Anything as a bonus feat. In addition, a charau-ka gains a +1 racial bonus on all thrown weapons, and their threat range for thrown weapons is doubled, as if the charau-ka possessed the Improved Critical feat for all thrown weapons. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Although they call themselves the charau-ka, these dangerous jungle dwellers are often known to colonists and explorers as ape-men. Legend holds that the charau-ka stem from the demon lord Angazhan, who transformed the bodies of the first humans that tried to wage war against his cult, causing the dead to rise as the first apemen.</p><p>Rumors that charau-ka clerics have perfected a hideous ritual to force those slain to reincarnate as new charau-ka are popular tales among jungle explorers-but proof of such a magic spell has yet to reach civilization.</p><p>Today, the charau-ka are one of the most fecund and widespread races of creatures in the Mwangi Expanse. Not all of them serve the Gorilla King or worship Angazhan; some have become feral monsters little more organized than apes, while others may have turned to the worship of other demon lords or even the snake-god Ydersius.</p><p>Charau-ka generally dwell in small tribes of a few dozen members. They often keep dangerous jungle creatures as pets or guardians, trusting to their druids or animal handlers to keep the deadly beasts under control. A typical charau-ka village extends from the jungle floor up into the canopy above, and usually includes several treehouse-style structures connected by vines or rope bridges.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Polyglot", "Source": "Inner Sea World Guide", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, patrol (3-8), or tribe (9-20 plus 1-3 dire apes, 1-3 fighter sub-chieftains of 2nd level, 1 cleric of Angazhan of 3rd-5th level, and 1 chieftain of any class of 4th-8th level)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(3d8+6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rock +5 (1d4+2/19-20)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1510, "SubType": "(charau-ka)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Throw AnythingB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth", "AC": "14, touch 12, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Charau-Ka", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +14, Fly +0, Perception +2, Stealth +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +4, Will +2", "Melee": "club +5 (1d4+3), bite +0 (1d3+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Small"}
