This allows the hellstoker to fire a jet of flame from its bellows in a line to a range of 30 feet, once per round as a standard action. It must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit a foe. A creature hit by the fire takes 1d8 points of fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch on fire. </h5><h5><b>Fiery Body (Ex)</b> The oil coating a hellstoker's body is highly flammable. As such, a hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into flames. This deals no damage to the hellstoker, and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds before extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide; therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (see oily hide below), and it can be caught on fire again. </h5><h5><b>Oily Hide (Ex)</b> Hellstokers do not secrete oil naturally, but their constant contact with it leaves them coated with a thick layer of the substance at all times. This grants hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (included in the statistics block). The oil cannot be washed off or removed. Additionally, if a hellstoker is hit with a fire effect, it bursts into flames. See the hellstoker's fiery body above for details.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Hellstokers (or marnasoths) maintain the oil, made from the flesh of mortals, in the infernal boilers located on the lowest region of Hell. They are rarely encountered anywhere else, though on occasion a team or retinue of hellstokers enters the Material Plane in search of fuel. Most just wait for the foolhardy mortals that enjoy plane-hopping to pop into their realm where any number of devils finish them off, leaving their rotting carcasses to the hellstokers. When fuel is running low and the hellstokers are short on mortals, they form bands that hunt down and kill the least ranking devils (such as lemures), tossing their slain bodies into the boilers.</p><p>Hellstokers attack using their longspears or natural weapons. They sometimes use <i><i>burning</i> hands</i> to set one another on fire, or they use it to ignite the oil in their bellows. When outnumbered, hellstokers usually use <i><i>burning</i> hands</i> against their foes and then teleport away to safety.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, team (4-7), or retinue (8-13)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 10", "Gear": "longspear, bellows", "Ranged": "ranged touch +6 (bellows)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.
