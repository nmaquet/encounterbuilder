This grants them proficiency with all simple, martial, and exotic weapons.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The tabaxi (called cat-people or tigerfolk by some) are a reclusive race of feline humanoids that dwell far from settled areas, making their home deep in the forests and jungles. They rarely engage in trade or dealings with other races, preferring to keep to themselves most of the time.</p><p>Tabaxis are very graceful and catlike in their movements. They resemble humanoids with feline characteristics most akin to a tiger. Both hands and feet sport vicious claws that can do significant damage when they leap upon their prey.</p><p>Although tabaxis have little use for clothing or other material possessions, they have a great fascination for and aptitude with weapons of all kinds, learning to employ them with great skill after only a little practice.</p><p>Tabaxis are skilled with using their claws and bite in combat, often striking from ambush or a height, pouncing upon their prey and attacking with all four claws at once. However, due to their love of weapons many will instead employ a hand-held weapon of some kind while in melee, foregoing their natural attacks. Tabaxis can still employ their bite as a secondary attack if using a weapon, as well as one claw as an offhand attack if the hand is free, but they cannot use their grab or rake abilities while doing so.</p><p>A typical tabaxi stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.<b></p><p>Tabaxi Society</b></p><p> Tabaxis live in small groups called prides deep in jungles and warm forests. A typical pride consists of 1-3 each of males, females, and young.</p><p>The females tend to be slightly larger than the males, and typically are the dominant members of a pride. They live a nomadic lifestyle, prowling through their chosen range and hunting in groups of three to five.</p><p>They carry little in the way of possessions, although they often sport a miscellaneous array of weapons wrested from past prey. Unless hungry most tabaxi prides leave other intelligent creatures alone, though they may attack if intruders in their range bear especially interesting-looking weaponry.</p><p><br><b>Tabaxi Characters</b><br> Tabaxi characters possess the following racial traits.<br><b>+2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom</b>.<br><b>Darkvision</b>: Tabaxis can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br><b>Racial Hit Dice:</b> A tabaxi begins with two levels of humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit <br><b>Dice</b>, a base attack bonus of +1, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +0, Ref +3, and Will +0.<br><b>Racial Skills:</b> A tabaxi's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 2 x (2 + Int modifier).<br><b>Racial Feats:</b> A tabaxi's humanoid levels give it one feat.<br><b>AC:</b> +1 natural armor bonus.<br><b>Natural Weapons:</b> Tabaxis can fight with 2 claws that deal 1d4 base damage, plus a bite attack that deals 1d3 base damage.
