The most noticeable feature of his humanoid torso is its arms-they end in snake heads rather than hands. Its snake arms and heads have a distinctive triangular shape with a pit above the nostrils and before the slit-like eyes. This creature has no legs but instead has the lower half of a monstrous rattlesnake complete with a foot long rattle which twitches ominously at the tip.</i></h3><br></br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Rattler Inphidian</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 4</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>1,200</h5><h5>NE Medium monstrous humanoid (reptilian)</h5><h5><b>Init </b>+2; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +15</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>18, touch 12, flat-footed 16 (+2 Dex, +6 natural)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>51 (6d10+18)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+5, <b>Ref </b>+7, <b>Will </b>+7</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>30 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>2 snake-hand bites +11 (1d6+4 plus poison)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>5 ft.; <b>Reach </b>5 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>death rattle, poison (DC 18)</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>18, <b>Dex </b>15, <b>Con </b>17, <b>Int </b> 12, <b>Wis </b>14, <b>Cha </b>13</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+6; <b>CMB </b>+10; <b>CMD </b>22</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Blind-Fight, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (snake-hand bites)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Climb +21, Diplomacy +7, Intimidate +10, Perception +15, Stealth +11, Swim +12; <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+4 Perception</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Common, Inphidian</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> warm forests and plains or underground</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary or band (1 rattler plus 2-5 common inphidians and 1 cobra-back inphidian)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div></h5><h5><b>Death Rattle (Su)</b>: Once every 1d4 rounds, a rattler inphidian can unleash a death rattle in a 40-foot radius around itself.

This is a sonic effect.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Rattler inphidians are one of the more powerful sub-races of inphidians and are often found in leadership roles such as commanders (though never generals or overseers) and tribal leaders (in the less-civilized inphidian nests). They are wicked killers who care nothing for life, valuing their own survival above anyone else's. This alone would seem to make them poor leaders (and has in some instances), but what they lack in compassion for others, they more than make up for with their leadership skills, instincts, and ability to ferret out spies, intruders, trespassers, and others who seek to disrupt the inphidian culture.</p><p>A rattler inphidian is 6 feet tall and about 8 feet long. It appears as an inphidian with the lower torso of a giant rattlesnake. Colors vary along the spectrum but most are brown, black, or dark gray with bands and diamond-shaped patterns covering its entire body. Like all inphidians, its hands are non-existent, a viper head being in its place. A rattler's eyes, as well as the eyes on its snake-hands are an iridescent red.</p><p>Cool calculating observers of their foes, rattlers are intelligent enough to pick their battles and fight only at a time and place of their own choosing. If overwhelmed or outnumbered, a rattler attempts to save itself, even using its allies as fodder if necessary. In combat, a rattler relies on its physical attacks and death rattle to vanquish its foes. A particular nasty tactic of a rattler is to paralyze a foe with its poison and then leave it to bake in the hot desert sun.<br><b>Rattler Inphidian Characters</b><br> <br><b>+8 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +4 Charisma</b>.<br><b>Base Speed:</b> A rattler inphidian's base land speed is 30 feet.
