A volcano giant wears ornaments made of bone, shell, and obsidian, and their general culture and society is similar to that of humanoid civilizations on tropical islands. Such island societies often get along well with local tribes of volcano giants, engaging in trade and peacefully coexisting. Should a tribe of volcano giants form an allegiance with a human tribe, the giants warn the humans of possible eruptions of their volcano to allow them time to escape the destruction.</p><p>Although volcano giants can be described as good-natured and peaceful people, their demeanor can change quickly. At a real or imagined affront, a volcano giant can erupt with a passion that is rivaled only by the fire and fury of the volcano in which it lives. Volcano giants feel that their shadow is actually their soul, and do not tolerate any creature that dares to trod upon it.</p><p>Volcano giants usually use Gargantuan longspears in combat. They are fierce and brave warriors, not backing down from any adversary. Many choose to open combat with their breath weapon so as to soften up their foes before attacking.<br><b>Volcano Giants Characters</b><br> <br><b>+22 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +12 Constitution, +2 Wisdom:</b> A volcano giant's prowess lies almost entirely in his physical abilities, predominantly strength.<br><b>Huge</b>: Volcano giants are huge and take a -2 penalty to AC, -2 penalty to attack rolls, +2 bonus to Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense, and a -8 penalty to Stealth checks.
