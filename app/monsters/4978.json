They may still run at 4 times their speed with light encumbrance (up to 228 lbs.), and 3 times their speed with medium (459 lbs.) or heavy (690 lbs.) encumbrance. </h5><h5><b>Hardy (Ex)</b> Rhiannas are extremely durable creatures. Unlike with other mounts, anytime a hustle, forced march or spurred movement would do damage to these horses, they are allowed a Constitution save to negate the damage.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Domesticated Rhiannas retain the notable traits of their wild ancestors: small size, endurance and sure-footedness. They are especially popular with woodsmen - those who opt for mounted travels - due to their hardiness, dexterity an companionship. Most homesteaders choose the Rhianna breed as well, as they are equally suited to long-distance rides over varied terrain and drawing a market cart over rutted roads. Only the heaviest farm labors, such as breaking sod, spring plowing and pulling stumps, are reserved for larger draft horses, and many of the farmers of the valley make do with Rhiannas alone. Rhianna horses differ from other light warhorses in several ways. Although they are similar in build to warhorses, they cannot fight with a rider. While their speed is the same, they do not perform as well when heavily loaded. Due to their evolution in a valley littered with obstacles such as trees, streams, boulders and scrub growth, they are extremely agile and adept at negotiating obstacles. They are resistant to damage incurred by fatigue, and may be pushed harder and for longer periods of time without the risk of injury. Because of their intolerance for encumbrance, Rhiannas make ideal mounts for lightly armed and armored heroes. Even encumbered, their ability to increase their speed for short distances gives them an advantage over common riding horses. This is especially useful when difficult terrain disallows running and charging.
