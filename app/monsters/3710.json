A nightgaunt gains a +8 racial bonus on all combat maneuver checks made to grapple (rather than the typical +4 bonus most creatures with the grab ability gain). If a nightgaunt uses its fly speed to move itself and a grappled target, it can fly at full speed. </h5><h5><b>Faceless (Ex)</b> A nightgaunt has no face, yet it can still see with remarkable clarity in all directions as if its entire body were a single strange eye. This unusual form of vision renders it immune to gaze attacks, but not to illusions that rely upon vision to function. A nightgaunt feeds on the despair and horror of its victims, which replaces the creature's need to eat and drink. It has no need to breathe at all, and is immune to all inhaled or scent-based effects. </h5><h5><b>Tickle (Ex)</b> A nightgaunt's long, sinuous tail is covered with razor-sharp barbs. While this appendage looks dangerous and is exceptionally agile, a nightgaunt's tail doesn't have much strength, and thus cannot be used as a natural weapon. Yet when a nightgaunt grapples a foe, its tail can slither along the target's flesh to tickle and tease with nauseating efficiency. Tickling a foe is a swift action, and the foe must either be helpless or grappled by the nightgaunt in order for it to use this ability. When a creature is tickled by a nightgaunt, the victim must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Nightgaunts haunt the deepest and darkest chasms of dream. They lurk in the shadows that loom at the edges of sane slumber, but are ready at any moment to snatch a blithe dreamer away, carrying it off into realms of endless nightmare and tickling it terribly all the way. They appear as stooped, emaciated humanoids, yet possess a strength in their sinewy limbs that far surpasses that of most humans. With inky black skin, batlike wings, long spiny tails, and demonic horns protruding from their skulls, nightgaunts are fearsome foes-yet it's their lack of any facial features makes the creatures truly nightmarish. A typical nightgaunt is 7 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds. <b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> Nightgaunts' most singular feature-their uncanny lack of features-is perhaps their most intriguing biological facet. That the creatures can see is manifestly obvious, for they react to purely visual stimulus with speed and precise action, as if their whole bodies can see in all directions. Scholars have yet to determine how the bizarre creatures accomplish this eerie stunt, but the fact that they were spawned originally in the depths of ancient nightmares might indicate that no sane or logical explanation for their sight exists. Nightgaunts feed on emotions; while fear and horror are the usual staples of nightgaunts' diet, the creatures actually prefer a meal of varied emotions. A mix of laughter and terror provides a succulent meal for nightgaunts. Little else can provoke as delectable a bouquet for a nightgaunt as lifting victims high into the air while tickling them with its long, whip-like tail, a situation that those who have survived relate as one that can never be forgotten. During this frightening feeding, a nightgaunt often carries its victims aloft for miles as it continually tickles and torments the poor souls, finally dropping its prey into a remote area where monsters and worse lie in wait once it has gorged itself. Although nightgaunts won't hesitate to drop particularly troublesome or dangerous creatures from a great height, they prefer to release those they carry off from heights of only a few feet, as if to ensure their survival in whatever eldritch wilderness the nightgaunts have brought their victims to. Nightgaunts rarely return to feed on creatures they've dropped off in a dangerous region (although the same cannot be said of victims who escape to safety), provoking theories that the creatures have some sort of ancient pact with the monstrous denizens of these remote locales. <b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> Nightgaunts dwell in the parts of the world that inspire nightmares, where dreamers pray for dawn. They can be found amid the creaking boughs of haunted forests, lurking in the caves of desolate mountain gorges, or perched atop crumbling gravestones in forgotten boneyards. Yet when they grow hungry, they take wing from their eerie lairs to seek out victims, scouring cities and towns for open windows from which to snatch their meals. Although nightgaunts can be found throughout Golarion, this is not their original home. The first nightgaunts were spawned deep in the Dimension of Dream from the nightmares of a forgotten poet whose fears were so consuming that every night he dreamt, his nightmares grew more and more powerful and overwhelming. Dreams of being carried over horrific landscapes and mind-numbing vistas of eldritch blight drove the poet deeper and deeper into madness, and in desperation he sought out the aid of a strange alchemist who supplied him with an elixir that would rid him of his fears forever. The poet took the draught and immediately fell into a deep slumber, and in that slumber, his nightmares fled his mind, transforming into the first and most powerful of the nightgaunt race. Unfortunately for the poet, the nightgaunts also took his muse, and when he woke the next morning, he found his ability to write had vanished forever-he had traded his soul for a life of gentle sleep. When he found he could not go on without his poetry, he sought out that strange alchemist in hopes of reversing what he'd done. The stories do not reveal what fate eventually met this strange and forlorn poet, but the nightgaunts have certainly prospered. Most nightgaunts have little drive to be anything more than predators of slumbering societies. They often gather in large colonies, entertaining each other by sharing emotions they've fed upon via strange touches and lingering caresses. Powerful warlords, wizards, priests, and the like often enjoin nightgaunts to serve them as guardians or even forms of travel, promising them slaves or other captured prey in return for their services, but those who traffic with nightgaunts must take care to stay in their faceless friends' good graces, for a nightgaunt can turn upon its allies at the smallest slight. Nightgaunts often war with the other creatures found in their desolate realms, led into battle by elder nightgaunts who carry strange magical tridents and command considerable magical powers. These elder nightgaunts typically have levels as magi or oracles-a nightgaunt colony led by such a powerful creature is a much more dangerous threat than most, for these colonies often have agendas that go beyond mere predation upon kinder societies. Nightgaunt elders are typically chaotic evil, and many use their followers to keep humanoids as cattle in horrific pens or cages in lightless caverns. The most powerful nightgaunts, though, are those original creations pulled from the mad poet's nightmares. These creatures are all-powerful spellcasters of prodigious size, and dwell in the deep underground realms below the Dimension of Dream, or else rule vast rookeries on the ragged borderlands that surround the dread Plateau of Leng. What their goals might be is not for sane minds to know.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo (cannot speak)", "Source": "AP 65", "Land": "1", "Organization": "single, pair, flight (3-12), or colony (13-50 plus 1-4 nightgaunt elders)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 14, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3710, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth", "AC": "18, touch 13, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Nightgaunt", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +7, Perception +6, Stealth +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +8, Will +6", "Melee": "2 claws +9 (1d6+4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 40 ft.
