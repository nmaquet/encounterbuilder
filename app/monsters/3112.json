This ability prevents a time flayer from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time flayer an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time flayer can restart it as a free action on its next turn. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex)</b> Time flayers are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including <i>time stop</i>, <i>temporal stasis</i>, and the like). </h5><h5><b>Reality Bend (Su)</b> As a free action, a time flayer can fold the dimensional space surrounding it so its true location is hard to discern. Attackers have a 50% miss chance each time they attack with melee or ranged weapons. This is similar to the miss chance granted by a <i>displacement</i> spell. <i>See invisibility</i> does not reveal the creature's location, but <i>true seeing</i> does. </h5><h5><b>Temporal Displacement (Su)</b> As a melee touch attack, a time flayer can send a creature a few seconds into the future. A DC 18 Fortitude save negates. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. This effectively removes that creature from combat for the duration. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it suffers no damage and is shunted aside. The time flayer can use this ability three times per day. </h5><h5><b>Time Jaunt (Su)</b> As a standard action, a time flayer can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by <i>greater teleport</i>. This ability transports the time flayer and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius that the time flayer designates. Unwilling creatures can attempt a DC 18 Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the <i>greater teleport</i> spell. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Unmaking (Su)</b> An opponent slain by a time flayer is unmade-erased from the very fabric of time. No memories or recollections of the unmade creature exist anywhere in reality. Past events the creature was responsible for are now attributed to an unknown-even if they recently took place. For example, suppose a great hero saved a kingdom from certain doom and then suffers the unmaking. The kingdom is still safe, but no one can quite recall who saved it. A creature that suffers the unmaking cannot be raised, resurrected, or restored to life by any means-not even a <i>wish</i> can restore an unmade creature. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore one who suffers this fate.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Time flayers are natives to the Elemental Plane of Time and are most often encountered on that plane, the Astral Plane, or the Ethereal Plane.</p><p>Occasionally a time flayer slips into the Material Plane, but most such encounters occur when a hole is torn in the time continuum and it pulls a time flayer through, depositing it on the Material Plane. When such an event occurs, a time flayer usually looks for a way back to its native plane (which usually consists of a place on the Material Plane where the time fabric has been weakened).</p><p>Some time flayers purposefully journey to the Material Plane as if they are searching for something-sages and scholars are unsure what it is they are looking for.</p><p>Time flayers coexist on their native plane with time elementals who they detest. Why this animosity exists is unknown, but neither creature likes the other and they always attack each other on sight.</p><p>Note that time flayers often gain the upper hand in this battle as they are unaffected by the aging attack of a time elemental.</p><p>Time flayers fight with their greatswords in battle all the while attempting to discern the most powerful foe in a group. Once it has targeted such a foe, it uses its temporal <i>displacement</i> ability to effectively remove that creature from combat for a few rounds. If faced with certain extinction, a time flayer rips a hole in the time continuum and slips away using its time jaunt ability.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common plus any five", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(13d10+19)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 20, Wis 20, Cha 19", "Gear": "+1 greatsword", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3112, "SubType": "(extraplanar, time)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Skill Focus (stealth), Weapon Focus (greatsword)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "28, touch 18, flat-footed 28", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Time Flayer", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +16, Bluff +20, Climb +10, Diplomacy +19, Escape Artist +16, Intimidate +20, Knowledge (history) +21, Knowledge (planes) +21, Perception +21, Stealth +24, Sense Motive +21, Survival +21", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "13", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Elemental Plane of Time", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "reality bend, time jaunt", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +12, Will +13", "Melee": "+1 greatsword +19/+14/+9 (2d6+7/19-20/x2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
