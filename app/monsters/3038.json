Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant. </h5><h5><b>Fronds (Ex)</b> Strangle weed attacks with fronds that can extend up to 20 feet from its central mass. Each strangle weed has 3-12 fronds. A strangle weed attacks with these fronds as a slam attack; although it can make only one attack per round, if it grapples a foe it is not denied its Dexterity bonus against non-grappled foes and can still make attacks of opportunity if it has any free fronds. Once a foe is grappled, the strangle weed can attempt to latch on 1-4 additional fronds each round as a standard action by means of a separate grapple check. Additional fronds attached to a foe do not do increased damage, but they do add a cumulative +2 bonus to the strangle weed's CMB on subsequent grapple checks against that foe. To free itself, the foe must succeed on a grapple check against every frond grappling it.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The strangle weed is a large plant that resembles a patch of seaweed.</p><p>Strangle weed is an ambush predator, relying on its similarity to seaweed to remain inconspicuous until prey wanders near, whereupon it lashes out with its fronds, attempting to grapple its foes, then pull them beneath the water and crush them.</p><p>A subterranean version of the strangle weed is believed to exist, though encounters with it are very rare. It is dark blackish-green and is found in underground pools, stagnant water, and the like.</p><p>A typical strangle weed is 12 feet in diameter, dark green and slightly slimy, with long, ropy fronds, each about ten feet long, radiating from its central mass. The strangle weed keeps these fronds concealed within its main mass when hiding from potential prey.</p><p>Credit The Strangle Weed originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary or patch (2-4)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "20 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3038, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Power Attack, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 9, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Strangle Weed", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +6, Stealth +1, Swim +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +1, Will +2", "Melee": "slam +7 (1d6+6 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 5 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
