The adherer automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot break free while the adherer is alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adherer is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 14 Reflex save. A successful DC 14 Strength check is needed to pry it off. The save and check DC are both Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>An application of boiling water thrown on the adherer deals 1d4 points of damage to it (and to any creature stuck to it). It also reduces both the Reflex save DC and the Strength check DC to 10 for 1 round. An application of fire deals damage to both the adherer and any creature stuck to it and weakens the adhesive (as above) for 1d3 rounds.</p><p>An application of the <i>universal solvent</i> automatically dissolves the adhesive. An adherer can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 1 hour after the creature dies.</p><p>Adherers are strange creatures found in forested areas or underground caverns. They resemble mummies at a distance (DC 20 Knowledge [religion] or Perception check from a distance of 10 feet or more to discern that the creature is not in fact a mummy), but are not in fact related to the aforementioned undead. Adherer's are malign creatures and attack just about any living creature they encounter.</p><p>An adherer is 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.</p><p>Adherers attack by ambushing their prey. When lying in wait, an adherer covers its body with leaves, sticks, or debris to better blend with its surroundings. When prey wanders too close, the adherer springs to the attack. They are cowardly creatures, and if spotted before they attack, flee from their potential prey.</p><p>The adherer attacks by pummeling its foes with its fists. Those successfully attacked are stuck to the adherer.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (can't speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 12, Con 14, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1843, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth when using sticks and leaves to camouflage itself in its natural environment", "AC": "16, touch 11, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Adherer", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +8, Stealth +6 (+14 Stealth when using sticks and leaves to camouflage itself in its natural environment)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +2, Will +4", "Melee": "2 slams +6 (1d6+2 plus adhesive)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Medium"}
