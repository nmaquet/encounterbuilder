Creatures of 2 HD or less are not only driven mad but are also compelled to worship the tentacled horror as a god (as if affected by a <i>charm person</i> spell, caster level 12th). Only a <i>restoration</i>, greater <i>restoration</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell can restore the mind of one driven insane by a tentacled horror. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes +2 for its Ability Focus feat. </h5><h5><b>Horn (Su)</b> The source of a tentacled horror's power is its horn. If a tentacled horror's horn is removed, it loses its regeneration ability and suffers a -6 penalty to Strength and Constitution until the horn is reattached. The horn is AC 20, hardness 10, and has 20 hit points. A tentacled horror's horn cannot be removed unless it is helpless. It takes a successful DC 40 Strength or 10 points of damage to the horn to remove a tentacled horror's horn.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Ancient and evil, a tentacled horror is a monstrosity from the unknown depths of the earth. This monster is most often found inhabiting dungeons or ruins far from the reaches of civilization.</p><p>Tentacled horrors are egotistical and lazy creatures, and put themselves above all others they encounter. Often, a tentacled horror that finds its way into a subterranean society will attempt to set itself up as a god.</p><p>Lesser creatures such as goblins often accept this false god and bring it sacrifices of living victims. Once ensconced as ruler-deity, a tentacled horror is content to remain in one place to be cared for by its subjects. A tentacled horror that has been in power for some time will be surrounded by a pool of its own slime and the scattered bones of its victims.</p><p>Exuding a foul oily slime wherever it goes, a tentacled horror has a powerful humanoid torso that ends in a thick slug-like foot. Sprouting from the torso are four whip-like tentacles tipped in cruel barbs. Most horrifying of all, however, is the face. A tentacled horror has a shapeless head with a single, huge, unblinking eye. The mouth of a tentacled horror is a yawning chasm of sharp teeth eager to sink into living flesh. Above the eye is a glistening black 2-foot long horn-the very source of the tentacled horror's power.</p><p>A tentacled horror attacks first with its tentacles, ripping and tearing at its opponent with the sharp barbs at the tip. Any grappled opponent is immediately bitten.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Goblin, Undercommon", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(15d8+75)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 18", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3103, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (aura of insanity), Blind-Fight, Cleave, Critical Focus, Improved Critical (tentacle), Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "22, touch 8, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Tentacled Horror", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +19, Intimidate +22, Knowledge (arcana) +20, Knowledge (dungeoneering) +17, Perception +21, Sense Motive +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "14", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +7, Will +14", "Melee": "4 tentacles +16 (1d8+7/19-20 plus grab), bite +16 (3d6+7)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Huge"}
