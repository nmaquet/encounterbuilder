A forgotten one has the benefits of tremorsense and blindsight within a 100-foot radius. It cannot be flanked or caught flat-footed. </h5><h5><b>Poison Use (Ex)</b> Forgotten Ones are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Forgotten ones use a mixture of bee and spider venom on their spears that causes severe itching and soreness. <i>Forgotten One Poison</i>-injury; save Fort DC 11; frequency 1/hour for 24 hours; effect -1 (non-cumulative) penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws, if the target fails at least 8 saves it also takes 1 point of Con damage; cure 1 save. Humanoids and monstrous humanoids have a 5% chance of being severely allergic to forgotten one poison. The effects of a failed save are as above, but the penalty is -2 rather than -1, and 1d3 Con damage. </h5><h5><b>Forgetful Presence (Su)</b> Three times per day, a forgotten one can cause any creature within 20 feet of it to forget an encounter with it as per a <i>modify memory</i> spell with the restriction that it can only remove memories specifically dealing with the forgotten one. Opponents that succeed on a DC 16 Will save avoid the effects. Opponents that make the save are immune to the forgetful presence of that forgotten one for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Forgotten ones are a sprite race related to pixies. These wee folk are natural spies and trackers, and are routinely employed by powerful forest-guarding fey creatures such as unicorns, dryads, and nymphs. It is not uncommon for travelers in a fey forest to be followed by scores of forgotten ones, all moving unnoticed through the treetops as quickly and quietly as squirrels. While some forgotten ones keep track of the interlopers, others send messages back and forth to alert more powerful fey guardians to the presence of outsiders.</p><p>A forgotten one is about a foot tall with pointed ears, slanted eyes, and long, nimble limbs. Most forgotten ones weave twigs and leaves into their hair for decoration and to help conceal themselves in the treetops.</p><p>Rangers are druids are especially fond of the forgotten ones, and often use them as intermediaries between themselves and the greater Fey guardians of the forest.</p><p>Forgotten ones try to avoid combat with anything larger than themselves-they are well aware of their own limitations. If hard pressed or ordered into combat by a greater fey creature to defend their forest, forgotten ones will fight with courage not often attributed to creatures of such small size.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Elven, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "troop (2-8) or clan (10-100)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 3, Dex 19, Con 11, Int 14, Wis 17, Cha 21", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "shortspear +9 (1d2-4 plus poison)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2606, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Knowledge [nature]), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Acrobatics when jumping, +4 Survival", "AC": "19, touch 18, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Forgotten One", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +10 (+6 jumping), Climb +10, Craft (alchemy) +8, Escape Artist +10, Knowledge (nature) +11, Perception +9, Sense Motive +9, Stealth +22, Survival +7", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "forgetful presence", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +7, Will +6", "Melee": "shortspear +9 (1d2-4 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Diminutive"}
