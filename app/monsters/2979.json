A creature attempting to cast a cure spell or heal spell on a creature damaged by the sabrewing's wing slash must make a successful caster level check (DC 18), or the spell has no effect on the injured character. The check DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>See Invisible (Sp)</b> A sabrewing can see invisible creatures as if using the see invisibility spell. This ability is always active. It can be negated, but the sabrewing can restart it as a free action on its next turn.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Sabrewings are winged humanoids from an unknown outer plane believed to be formed of rock and lined with razor-sharp blades of all shapes and sizes. These creatures delight in killing those weaker than themselves and often travel the outer planes preying on such creatures when they encounter them. Evil spellcasters and powerful outsiders (demon lords, arch-devils, lesser dukes, and so on) sometimes employ these creatures as assassins because of the sabrewing's skill at killing and the creature's desire to do nothing else. They are not averse to venturing to the Material Plane to answer an evil summons, and often do so, usually with the intent of fulfilling the bargain and then killing the summoner (if possible). If called by a powerful outsider, a sabrewing will not attempt to kill its summoner, as it's smart enough to know when it's outmatched. In such cases, they simply do their job and then return to their native plane.</p><p>Little is known of their native plane, but one adventurer that has supposedly seen this place speaks of huge citadels and fortresses constructed of iron and earth surrounded by \"forests of steel blades.\" This information has never been substantiated and plane jumpers have been unable to locate such a plane. (Perhaps the sabrewings do not actually have their own native plane but implanted such false information to detour those that would seek them out.) Sabrewings prefer to attack from the air, using speed to their advantage while also staying out of the reach of their opponents. Before combat, sabrewings usually cast <i>magic weapon</i> or <i>greater <i>magic weapon</i></i> on their wings before engaging in combat so they can use their wings to the utmost advantage Multiple sabrewings work in concert with one another to bring down foes; one draws an opponent's attention while another swoops in from behind and slashes with its deadly wings.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sabrewing", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or wing (5-8)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 15, Con 20, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2979, "SubType": "(evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+2 Perception", "AC": "19, touch 12, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Sabrewing", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Escape Artist +11, Intimidate +11, Knowledge (planes) +10, Perception +13, Sense Motive +11, Stealth +11, Survival +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "outer planes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +7, Will +4", "Melee": "2 wing slashes +11 (1d6+5/19-20/x3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 60ft.
