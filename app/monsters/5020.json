These creatures sustain themselves on a diet of swamp creatures: alligators, fish, and adventurers and just about anything else that enters their domain. Slain prey is either devoured immediately or dragged back to the nithu's lair where it is slowly devoured over the course of a few days. A nithu's lair is a well-hidden and dark cave, cavern, or other such place. Nithus occasionally make truces with nearby humanoids (particularly orcs, gnolls, and goblins) in exchange for a steady supply of food (victims). Nithus are solitary creatures and extremely territorial, even fighting their own kind for control of an area. No encounters of multiple nithus have been recorded. Sages are unsure how (and if) nithu reproduce. They appear to be sexless creatures and no young have ever been encountered. A typical nithu has a lifespan of 20 years. As a nithu ages, its color shifts from translucent light gray to a darker, but still semi-translucent gray. Its tentacles, usually the same color as the body change colors as well. A nithu cares little to nothing for treasure; thus, any treasure found in or around its lair is typically all that remains of those who have fallen prey to the creature's insatiable hunger. The nithu is an ambush hunter, preferring to lay in wait for potential prey to pass near. A nithu picks and chooses its targets carefully. The creature's average intelligence is enough to let it to know when it is outmanned and outclassed; thus it prefers to attack the lone straggler or a party member who may have become lost in the monster's swampy lair. Unless extremely hungry, an nithu doesn't attack a large group of creatures unless it itself is threatened and attacked first or unless it is assured of victory.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common (cannot speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d8+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 21, Con 16, Int 11, Wis 14, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5020, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 14, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Nithu", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +16, Intimidate +10, Perception +18, Stealth +10, Survival +11", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests or marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +7, Will +8", "Melee": "4 tentacles +10 (1d8+3 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 40 ft.
