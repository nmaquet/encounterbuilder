Anyone within 30 feet who sets eyes upon the hooded horror must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be instantly weakened, taking 1d6 points of Strength damage. Creatures that are affected by this ability or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same hooded horror's horrific appearance for one day. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A hooded horror is an undead creature believed to have been created by Orcus in order to subjugate and corrupt paladins and good-aligned priests. Though often found wandering the Undead Lord's great abyssal palace, the hooded horror itself is not native to that plane, as Orcus created and unleashed them on the Material Plane (if the legends are to be believed). Hooded horrors spend their time seeking out priests and paladins in order to fulfill their desires and are often found amidst graveyards, ruined temples to good-aligned deities, and other such places where its chosen targets might be encountered. A hooded horror appears as a rotting and skeletal humanoid cloaked in a brownish-black hooded robe. Its eyes are deep sockets, pitch black with a small pinpoint of red light. Its hands end in razor-sharp talons. Hooded horrors understand Abyssal, Celestial, and Common, but do not appear to speak any of these languages. Methods of communication with (and between) these creatures is unknown. A hooded horror begins an encounter by revealing its desiccated countenance to its foes thereby invoking fear in those that see it. Creatures that succeed on their save are then assaulted by the creature's breath weapon and filthy claws. If it can, the hooded horror attempts to charm and bring under its control any paladins and good-aligned priests it encounters. Other good-aligned creatures that oppose the hooded horror are simply destroyed.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common (can't speak any languages)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d8+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 16, Con -, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4976, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (desiccating breath), Dodge, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "24, touch 14, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Hooded Horror", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Disguise +11, Intimidate +16, Knowledge (arcana) +10, Knowledge (planes) +7, Knowledge (religion) +10, Perception +15, Sense Motive +15, Stealth +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "11", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +8, Will +11", "Melee": "2 claws +10 (1d8+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
