They are feared by subterranean dwellers for their toxic bite which causes its victims to become delusional or lost in deep dark cavern recesses. Cavern crawlers lair in areas where food is plentiful; when their source of food runs out, they move the entire lair to a new area, digging new tunnels and chambers as needed by the nest. A cavern crawler can go roughly a week without food before it begins to exhibit signs of starvation. Many resort to cannibalism before that happens however. A cavern crawler nest consists of a single female and several male workers and soldiers. The workers hunt for and supply needed food for the nest while the soldiers guard the female and young. The female lays 10-20 eggs at one time which are buried beneath the ground in a special chamber dug off the main chamber of the lair. Eggs hatch 60-90 days after incubation and young reach maturity in about 12 months. A cavern crawler has a reptilian head similar to that of an iguana and eighteen short clawed legs on each side of its body which allows it to climb on any rocky surface with ease. Its body is slate gray and lighter on the underside. Its legs are covered in short bristles of dark gray or black. A typical cavern crawler can reach lengths of 6 feet or more. Some species up to 12 feet long are rumored to have been encountered by unsuspecting adventurers, but these reports have yet to be confirmed. A cavern crawler attacks from ambush, clinging to stalactites or overhangs and dropping on its unsuspecting prey. The target is subjected to repeated bites and dragged to a safe place before being devoured by the cavern crawler.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), or swarm (6-12)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(6d10+18)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4760, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Climb", "AC": "20, touch 12, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Cavern Crawler", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +22, Perception +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +7, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +11 (1d8+6 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
