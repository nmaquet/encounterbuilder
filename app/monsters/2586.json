It cannot be flanked. </h5><h5><b>Eye Rays (Su)</b> Each of the creature's eyes stalks can produce a magical ray once per round as a free action. The creature can aim both of its eye rays in any direction. Each of its eye rays resembles a spell cast by a 12th-level caster and follows the rules for a ray (see Aiming a Spell in the <i>Core</i> Rulebook). Each eye ray has a range of 150 feet and a save DC of 17. The save DC is Constitution-based. <i>Hold Person</i> Left eye-A target struck by this ray must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the spell. An eye of the deep will use this ray early in a fight so as to disable its opponents. <i>Hold Monster</i> Right eye-A target struck by this ray must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the spell. This is used in the same manner as the <i>hold person</i> ray. <i>Minor Image</i> By combining the rays of both eyes, the eye of the deep can replicate the <i>minor image</i> spell. It does not have to succeed on an attack roll to use this ray. The illusion is generated at any point within range and in the eye of the deep's line of sight. </h5><h5><b>Stun Cone (Su)</b> An eye of the deep's central eye can, once per round, produce a cone extending straight ahead from its front to a range of 30 feet. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Feats</b> An eye of the deep's Flyby Attack feat allows it to take a move action and another standard action at any point during the move while swimming. It cannot take a second move action during a round in which it makes a flyby attack.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Eyes of the deep are found only in the deepest parts of the ocean, though on occasion one moves too close to the shoreline and ends up beaching on the sands. An eye of the deep stranded in this manner dies in 2d4 minutes unless placed back into the water.</p><p>An eye of the deep floats slowly through the oceans searching for its prey. It attacks using its eye rays; then it grasps an opponent with its pincers and subjects the victim to its bite attack. An eye of the deep's pincers are considered to be primary attacks.</p><p>Credit The Eye of the Deep originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Aquan, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or cluster (3-6)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d8+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "eye ray +7 (spell-like ability)", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2586, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Improved Natural Attack (pincers), Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Perception", "AC": "15, touch 10, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Eye Of The Deep", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Knowledge (nature) +14, Perception +18, Stealth +13, Survival +14, Swim +21", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +3, Will +10", "Melee": "2 pincers +7 (1d8 plus grab), bite +7 (1d6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., swim 20 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Medium"}
