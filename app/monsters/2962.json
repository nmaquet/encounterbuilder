The save DC is Constitution-based. If a rakkelthorn toad is killed or subdued before it has fired all of its thorns in a given day, the poison can be extracted from its remaining thorns. A successful DC 16 Heal or Craft (alchemy) check allows the poison to be changed into a mild anesthetic; one rakkelthorn toad provides enough for one dose. A single dose of this anesthetic, applied to the wound of an injured creature, provides a +2 circumstance bonus to Heal checks (multiple doses do not stack). This bonus lasts for one hour, after which time the anesthesia wears off. Poison cannot be extracted from thorns that have been fired by the rakklethorn. </h5><h5><b>Thorns (Ex)</b> From its back, the rakklethorn toad can fire a volley of thorns once per round as a standard action. All thorns in the cluster either hit or miss their target and deal 1d6 points of damage plus poison (see above). This attack has a range of 50 feet with no range increment. The rakklethorn toad can launch a total of 6 such volleys per day.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Relatives of poisonous toads, rakklethorns live in small packs in murky swamps. Rakklethorn toad packs are fiercely territorial, and battles between them are frequent. Occasionally, however, the rakklethorn toads enter a mating frenzy. Several packs merge and form a great swarm of noisy frogs that sweeps through the marshes like a wave. After a mating frenzy, females release hundreds of jelly-like eggs into the waters. Of all those eggs, only a very small fraction live long enough to hatch into tadpoles.</p><p>A rakklethorn toad attacks by arching its back and firing a volley of thorns at an opponent. It rarely ever closes to melee, preferring to attack at range. If confronted in close quarters, a rakklethorn toad usually flees or if cornered, attacks with its bite.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "pack (2-5) or mating swarm (6-36)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d10+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "thorn volley +5 (1d6 plus poison)", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2962, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "15, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Rakklethorn Toad", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +4, Stealth +7 (+ 13 in areas of tall grass or dense undergrowth).", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 300, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm marshes", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +5, Will +0", "Melee": "bite +5 (1d4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
