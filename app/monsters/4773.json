It is uncertain how the daochyns manage to cross from their home plane to the Material Plane. Sailors' legends say that in the middle of the deepest ocean there is a massive waterspout that is the nexus of a permanent gate between this world and the Plane of Water. This waterspout has never been documented or proven to exist, however, so that tale remains in doubt. The most powerful daochyns are sometimes worshipped as gods by seafaring creatures such as sahuagin and some clans of merfolk. Daochyns are in a constant state of motion and never stop swimming. Generally an encounter is with a solitary creature, though some do travel in pods or family units of up to twelve creatures. Sages are not sure how daochyns procreate but encounters with young have been reported (though these encounters could in fact be with smaller adult daochyns rather than young). On the Plane of Water daochyns sustain themselves on a diet of small elemental fish and other creatures. On the Material Plane, daochyns eat a variety of foods ranging from aquatic plants to fish to those swimmers unlucky enough to run across a hungry sea phantom. A typical daochyn is 5 feet long and weighs 150 pounds. In combat, a daochyn lashes out with its tongue, attempting to weaken stronger opponents with its desalination attack, while attacking other opponents with its tail and raking claws. An opponent that gets too close is subjected to a bite from its massive jaws. A daochyn has the ability to alter its coloration to appear almost transparent while in water and does so if attacking from ambush or attempting to flee.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or pod (4-12)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 16, Con 18, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4773, "SubType": "(extraplanar, water)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Lunge, Mobility, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in water", "AC": "20, touch 14, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Daochyn", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Knowledge (planes) +9, Perception +12, Stealth +14 (+22 in water), Swim +22", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Water)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +9, Will +3", "Melee": "bite +11 (1d6+3), 2 claws +11 (1d4+3), tail slap +6 (1d6+1) or tongue +11 (desalination and grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "swim 50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
