Though they prefer rotting bodies and often bury their victims for a while to improve their taste, they eat fresh kills if they are hungry enough.</p><p>Though most surface ghouls live primitively, rumors speak of ghoul cities deep underground led by priests who worship ancient cruel gods or strange demon lords of hunger. These \"civilized\" ghouls are no less horrific in their eating habits, and in fact the concept of a welllaid ghoul banquet table is perhaps even more horrifying than the concept of taking a meal fresh from the coffin.</p><p><b>Ghast</b><br> Ghasts are ghouls with the advanced monster template. A ghast's paralysis even affects elves. Ghasts roam in packs of their own kind or lead groups of common ghouls. The stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming, granting them the stench extraordinary ability (10-foot radius, Fort DC 15 negates, sickened for 1d6+4 minutes).</p><p><b>Lacedon</b><br> These aquatic cousins of the ghoul lurk near hidden reefs or other places where ships are likely to meet their ends.</p><p>Lacedons have a base land speed of 30 feet and a swim speed of 30 feet.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-4), or pack (7-12)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 15, Con -, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 204, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 12, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Ghoul", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +4, Climb +6, Perception +7, Stealth +7, Swim +3", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +5", "Melee": "bite +3 (1d6+1 plus disease and paralysis) and 2 claws +3 (1d6+1 plus paralysis)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "adult", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
