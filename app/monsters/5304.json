It gains a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. Bluff and Disguise are always class skills for a mi-go. </h5><h5><b>Evisceration (Ex)</b> A mi-go's claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing surgical operations upon helpless creatures or those it has grappled. When a mi-go makes a successful grapple check, in addition to any other effects caused by a successful grapple, it deals sneak attack damage to the victim. A creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of ability damage from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs). The save DC is Dexterity-based. </h5><h5><b>Item Creation (Ex)</b> A mi-go possesses the ability to create strange items that blur the line between magic and technology, given time and resources. This ability allows a mi-go to ignore all of the Item Creation feat requirements and spellcasting requirements for creating a magic item; the resulting item is always mi-go technology. A mi-go can use the Heal skill to craft mi-go technology. When a mi-go uses this ability to craft an item, it must use a larger amount of strange ingredients and expendable resources-this effectively doubles the gp cost to create the item. </h5><h5><b>Starflight (Su)</b> A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)-provided the mi-go knows the way to its destination.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Mi-go are both scientists and colonists-extraterrestrial travelers from deep space who view the universe as a canvas to be mastered and controlled. Their numbers on any particular planet can vary, but taken on a galactic scale, are mind-numbing in scope. Although a mi-go's shape might suggest it is an arthropod, the creature is in fact a highly evolved form of extraterrestrial fungus. Mi-go communicate via a combination of clicking pincers and subtle shifts in the coloration of their bulbous heads. A typical mi-go is roughly the size of a human, but weighs only 90 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aklo, Common, Mi-Go", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, scouting party (3-9), or invasion (9-16)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+35)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 20, Con 21, Int 25, Wis 14, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5304, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Deceitful, Dodge, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Bluff, +4 Disguise", "AC": "20, touch 16, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mi-Go", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +18, Disable Device +12, Disguise +18, Fly +9, Heal +9, Knowledge (arcana, geography) +14, Perception +12, Spellcraft +14, Stealth +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "deceptive, item creation, no breath, starflight", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +7, Will +4", "Melee": "4 claws +10 (1d4+3 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 50 ft.
