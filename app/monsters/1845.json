This generates massive waves up to 30 feet tall that may capsize boats and ships within 100 feet of the afanc. Boats and ships less than 20 feet long automatically capsize. Boats over 20 feet long may or may not capsize depending on the skill of the one piloting the vessel. A character steering or guiding a boat or ship over 20 feet long that succeeds on a DC 37 Profession (sailor) check manages to keep the boat afloat; otherwise it capsizes, spilling its contents into the water. The check DC is Strength-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Afancs are the sea monsters that sailors talk about when spinning tales of the sea. They are the creatures responsible for entire fleets and crews being lost or destroyed. They are thought by many to be the \"kings\" of the sea as most other water-dwellers pale in comparison both in strength and size to the mighty afanc.</p><p>Afancs are omnivorous hunters of the deep sea, feeding on a mixed diet of kelp, coral, sea plants, sharks, whales, various other large fishes, and swimmers and sailors unfortunate enough to cross the path of an afanc.</p><p>Afancs are sometimes worshipped as sea gods by small towns, villages, and seaside communities. Sacrifices to the \"Great Whale Gods\" include in various forms enormous amounts of cultivated sea plants, massive amounts of fish that have been netted, young girls or women, and occasionally an entire ship laden with criminals who are to be executed for their crimes.</p><p>An afanc is generally about 100 feet long though specimens as large as 200 feet long are thought to exist. Its whale-like body is colored gray or sometimes bluish-green and its eyes are always blue. Its tail is extremely long and ends in a truncated or flat, square edge. An afanc has a bulbous, somewhat flattened head, not unlike that of a great catfish.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "14", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(23d10+207)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 42, Dex 13, Con 28, Int 3, Wis 15, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "20 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1845, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Diehard, Endurance, Greater Sunder, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Natural Attack (bite), Improved Sunder, Iron Will, Power Attack, Swim-By Attack, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "22", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 3, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Afanc", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +28, Swim +24", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "11", "Race": "", "CR": "17", "XP": 102400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +22, Ref +14, Will +11", "Melee": "bite +32 (5d6+16), 2 claws +31 (2d8+16)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "5 ft., swim 60 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Colossal"}
