Legends speak of long ago wars between various races that drove humans underground. For a while, they survived on what food they could forage, but eventually turned to cannibalism; beginning with small underground animals such as rats and other rodents, and eventually turning to aboveground raids on other races. Grimlocks dine on humanoid flesh and blood (with humans and dwarves being their favorite meals). They are primitive creatures, living in tribal communities of up to 60 or more individuals in underground caves and tunnels. Raiding and hunting bands often venture to the surface world to attack nearby settlements, capturing or killing those they encounter and returning to their lair to feast upon their spoils. Raids such as these are always conducted at night under the cover of darkness when grimlocks have the advantage. Grimlocks detest sunlight but are not harmed by it. When not raiding the surface world, grimlocks often battle with other subterranean races including drow, dwarves, duergar, and even other grimlock tribes. Such battles can consist of outright warfare, but most of the time the battles are simple raids into other underground lairs to procure food (usually human or dwarven slaves kept by the other underground races). When engaged in wars with other races, grimlock leaders often ride basilisks into battle. Some larger grimlock lairs often have at least one medusa in midst as well. A grimlock stands 5 to 6 feet tall and weighs 150 to 200 pounds. Its skin is slate gray and its hair is oily and matted. The creature emanates a stench that most others find nauseating, yet to a grimlock, it's a means of identification, for each scent is unique to a grimlock. Such fine distinctions are noticeable to other grimlocks, and possibly other creatures with a strong olfactory sense. Due to their lack of sight, grimlocks prefer melee to ranged combat and close on enemies quickly when engaged. They attack with their menacing axes or powerful slams, slashing or pummeling their foes until their opponents are dead. Opponents that attempt to flee are run down and killed. Grimlocks that fall in combat are \"honored\" by being carried off the field of battle and devoured by their own. Recent forays into underground caverns and caves by an intrepid band of adventurers speak of another race of grimlocks, civilized, and non-cannibalistic. These same adventurers speak of a large underground city full of these creatures. Whether these are truly advanced grimlocks or another race entirely is yet to be confirmed.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Grimlock, Undercommon", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "Gang (2-4), hunting party (5-8), pack (10-20), or tribe (10-60 plus 1 leader of 3rd-5th level per 10 adults)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d10+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "monstrous humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4971, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "AlertnessB, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in stony environs", "AC": "15, touch 11, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Grimlock", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +7, Perception +9, Sense Motive +1, Stealth +6 (+14 in stony environs), Survival +4", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +4, Will +2", "Melee": "battleaxe +4 (1d8+2) or 2 slams +4 (1d4+2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
