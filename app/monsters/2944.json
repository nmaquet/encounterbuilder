Creatures hitting an acid quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack. </h5><h5><b>Acid Swimmer (Ex)</b> Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic nature of their environment on their home plane. </h5><h5><b>Drench (Ex)</b> The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can <i>dispel magic</i>al fire as <i>dispel magic</i> (caster level equals the quasi-elemental's HD). </h5><h5><b>Fumes (Ex)</b> The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body act as an inhaled poison. Creatures within 5 ft. of an acid quasi-elemental must make succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage each round. This poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves more than 5 ft. away from the acid quasielemental. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Water (Ex)</b> An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by water. An acid quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasielemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasielemental within its area of effect. Damage from waterbased attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasielemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Nestled among the various elemental there lies a plane composed entirely of acid. It is a place of noxious fumes and roiling, bubbling, pools. Plane jumpers do well to avoid this place as it is considered by many to be one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest, of the elementalbased planes.</p><p>Acid quasi-elementals rarely journey from their native plane, except when summoned. They do not like the Material Plane and when called to the place, are usually angered and always a bit uncomfortable. They have no trouble moving on land, but prefer the sanctity of their native plane to all others. At rest, an acid quasi-elemental is a clear puddle of liquid with a slightly green hue. It can rise up like a wave in a manner similar to a water elemental, or ooze along solid surfaces by sending out tendrils and pulling itself along. Wherever it travels, it leaves behind a shallow trough that emits wisps of smoke.</p><p>Acid quasi-elementals are almost always encountered in large pools of acid when on the Material Plane and rarely leave these pools when combating foes. A favored tactic is to grab a foe and pull it into the quasielemental's acid pool, subjecting it to massive amounts of acid damage (see the <i>Core Rulebook</i> for details).</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 11, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2944, "SubType": "(acid, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "0", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 11, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Small Acid Quasi-elemental", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Knowledge (planes) +1, Perception +4, Stealth +8, Swim +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Quasi-Plane of Acid", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +2", "Melee": "slam +2 (1d3 plus 1d3 acid)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., swim 80 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
