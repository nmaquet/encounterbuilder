Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 27 Reflex save or take 2d8 points of fire damage as clothes catch fire or armor and weapons become searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d8 rounds after the attack or until the flames are extinguished. Combustibles in the area automatically catch on fire.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>One of the most feared creatures from the Plane of Fire is the dreaded elemental fire dragon. They make their homes in the heart of the many volcanoes that dot the elemental landscape. Composed entirely of flames, these magnificent creatures fear little and are respected and feared by those that have encountered them. Elemental fire dragons are malign, vicious, and thoroughly evil. They delight in killing and torturing others, especially magmin (whom they relish as a delicacy). They often employ salamanders to aid them in their adventures, but once they have accomplished their goals, any surviving salamanders are usually devoured.</p><p>Elemental fire dragons cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid, but they can fly or step over it. The typical elemental fire dragon is at least 30 feet long.</p><p>Elemental fire dragons are ruthless adversaries. They care nothing for treasure or anything of value. An elemental fire dragon attempts to annihilate its opponents using any means possible.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Ignan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "20", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(24d10+120)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 23, Con 21, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.
