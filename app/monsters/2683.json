The first is a trilling croak like that of a frog. All opponents with 30 feet hearing this trilling must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d6+4 rounds. Opponents within 10 feet must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Alternately, a herald can focus its bellow attack against a single opponent within 100 feet. The opponent takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DCs are Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Bloated (Ex)</b> Because of its bloated, heavy body, a herald of Tsathogga that attacks with more than 5 tentacles in one round cannot move that round. </h5><h5><b>Regeneration (Ex)</b> A herald of Tsathogga takes normal damage from fire and good-aligned weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The dark, dismal tropical swamps and fens of the world are home to a horrible creature known only as the herald of Tsathogga. A vaguely froglike thing almost 20 feet across, the herald of Tsathogga is a nightmare creature that is spoken of only in hushed whispers. The creature is believed to have been created by the Frog God as punishment against humanity for wrongdoings done to Tsathogga and his worshippers.</p><p>Its warty, putrid skin is a pale yellow-green, and two monstrous eyes that have seen unknown secrets gaze from its fleshy face. The body of the thing resembles that of a massive toad, but rather than legs the herald of Tsathogga drags itself through the murky terrain on ten thick tentacles.</p><p>These tentacles are covered in tiny lancets that inject paralytic venom.</p><p>Some who have seen the herald of Tsathogga swear that it is capable of flight, but these reports are dismissed as madman's fantasy.</p><p>Though only one herald is thought to exist, rumors as of late, speak of at least three of these creatures in existence.</p><p>A herald of Tsathogga attacks first with its tentacles, attempting to paralyze or otherwise incapacitate as many opponents as possible.</p><p>Paralyzed opponents are pulled to the creature's maw and bitten. Its tentacles are not coordinated enough to grab moving targets, so it cannot pick up opponents that have not been paralyzed.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Erica Balsley.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(22d8+132)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 24, Dex 16, Con 20, Int 7, Wis 16, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "10 ft.
