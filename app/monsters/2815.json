The mihstu attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can slash (with a tentacle) the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its attack roll. It can still use its tentacles to strike at other targets. Attacks that hit an engulfing mihstu deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. </h5><h5><b>Resistance to Missile Attacks (Ex)</b> Ranged attacks (including <i>magic</i> missile) used against a mihstu have a 50% miss chance. </h5><h5><b>Susceptible to Cold (Ex)</b> Cold-based attacks and effects deal no damage to a mihstu, but stun it. If the cold-based effect allows a saving throw and the mihstu succeeds on its save, it ignores the stun effect. If it fails its save, or if the effect doesn't allow a save, the mihstu is stunned for 1d4+2 rounds.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Mihstus are semi-solid creatures from the Plane of Air. They are found in cool, damp, dark areas such as ruins, dungeons, and underground caves and caverns. The mihstu can shape its body at will and almost always appears on the Material Plane as a cloud of swirling vapor. It can seep through small cracks and openings.</p><p>When threatened, a mihstu forms four tentacles from its body. Each tentacle ends in a razor-sharp, barb-like talon. It slashes at its opponents using these tentacles. The mihstu can also engulf an opponent in its misty form. A mihstu's natural weapons are treated as <i>magic</i> weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Credit The Mihstu originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d10+16)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 22, Con 14, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2815, "SubType": "(air, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Initiative, Mobility, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "23, touch 17, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mihstu", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +14, Escape Artist +14, Fly +21, Knowledge (planes) +13, Perception +13, Sense Motive +13, Stealth +17, Survival +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Plane of Air", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +12, Will +4", "Melee": "4 tentacles +14(1d6+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., fly 20 ft.
