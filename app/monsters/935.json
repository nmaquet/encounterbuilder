The target must make a DC 16 Will saving throw or become captivated by the kelpie, thinking she is a desirable woman, in mortal danger, or (if in hippocampus, horse, or pony form) a valuable steed. A victim under the effects of the captivating lure moves toward the kelpie using the most direct means available. If the path leads the victim into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril; the victim does not consider water a dangerous area, and will enter the water even if it cannot swim or breathe. The captivated creature can take no actions other than to move toward the kelpie and defend itself, even if it is drowning. A victim within 5 feet of the kelpie simply stands and offers no resistance to her attacks. This effect continues as long as the kelpie is alive and the victim is within 1 mile of the kelpie. This is a mindaffecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Grab (Ex)</b> A kelpie can use its grab ability on a creature its own size or smaller.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>In their true form, kelpies are indistinguishable from normal seaweed. They are found in saltwater and freshwater, swamps, fens, and stagnated underground pools and lakes. Sages and scholars believe the kelpies were created by an evil water elemental goddess. In her human guise, a kelpie appears as a beautiful female with long flowing dark hair, emerald eyes, and soft, pale skin. She is cloaked in robes of seaweed or wears nothing at all. A kelpie often assumes a semihuman form in which her lower torso is composed entirely of seaweed.</p><p>Kelpies speak Common and some speak Aquan.</p><p>Kelpies lie in wait for their foes (most often males), and when a target moves within range, they reshape their form to appear human (in most cases, they take the form of a drowning woman) so as to lure the target closer. If the ruse is not detected and the opponent moves within 5 feet of the kelpie, she attacks, attempting to drown her victim. Drowned foes are taken back to the kelpie's lair and devoured.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Aquan, Common, Sylvan; telepathy 1 mile (touched creatures only)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Revised", "Land": "1", "Organization": "Solitary or bed (1-4)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d6+14)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 15, Dex 16, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 935, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Deceitful, Improved Initiative, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Kelpie", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +15, Disguise +15, Perception +13, Sense Motive +13, Stealth +13, Swim +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "Any aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "amphibious, change shape (hippocampus, horse, Small or Medium humanoid or horse-headed humanoid, alter self or beast shape IV)", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +8, Will +6", "Melee": "2 slams +6 (1d6+2 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
