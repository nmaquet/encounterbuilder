After that time, its body begins to decay and it takes on an appearance similar to that of a ghoul or zombie.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>When a person is murdered, the spirit sometimes clings to the Material Plane, refusing to accept its mortal death. This spirit possesses its original body and seeks out those responsible for its murder. It will never rest until those responsible are sought out and slain.</p><p>Since the transformation into unlife is almost instant (occurring within 1-2 hours after death), the bhuta appears as it did in life. Close inspection (DC 16 Perception check) reveals slight decay, and the body still shows signs of any trauma suffered prior to death (wounds, disease, burns, or the like), but outwardly, the bhuta for the most part appears as a normal creature of its race. In its undead state, the bhuta sustains itself on a diet of flesh, preferring that of humans and elves.</p><p>A bhuta attacks with its claws in combat. If facing its killers, it uses its death grip attack on the one who actually killed it (the one who delivered the killing blow) and usually only releases its hold when either it or its target is dead. If combat goes against it, a bhuta does not hesitate to retreat, picking a more opportune time in the future to exact its revenge.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d8+18 plus 9)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 20, Dex 14, Con -, Int 12, Wis 16, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2263, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness, Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 12, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Bhuta", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +17, Escape Artist +11, Intimidate +14, Knowledge (religion) +6, Perception +16, Stealth +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land or underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "find target, gentle repose", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +9", "Melee": "2 claws +12 (1d8+5 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
