A mountain troll prefers to withdraw and observe before entering combat, lumbering forth to attack only if intruders make clear their intentions to harm it or its allies, or if the newcomers seem to be encroaching upon the troll's territory rather than simply passing through. Once enraged, a mountain troll is a savage opponent, calling upon its native strength and alliances with elementals to bury its opponents in stone or spread their entrails across the slopes. Mountain trolls prefer to live in narrow ravines or shallow caves that allow them to look out over the landscape. They sometimes knuckle-walk like a gorilla, but when angered they rear up to their full height of nearly 30 feet. Mountain trolls have a close association with the First World, similar to that possessed by gnomes, which grants them magical abilities and unusual patience. They are quick to forge alliances with fey, and while they see smaller trolls as sadists, they nonetheless feel a sort of familial responsibility. Lesser trolls often capitalize upon mountain trolls' generosity, but take care to abide by their larger cousins' rules when sheltering in their homes. Mountain trolls have even been known to aid explorers or give advice, provided they are treated with respect.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "Lands Of The Linnorm Kings", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(18d8+126)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 36, Dex 13, Con 25, Int 7, Wis 16, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rock +13/+8/+3 (2d8+19)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1908, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Deadly Aim, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Iron Will, Improved Vital Strike, Iron Will, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "18", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "29, touch 9, flat-footed 28", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Mountain Troll", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +33, Perception +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "15", "Race": "", "CR": "14", "XP": 38400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +18, Ref +7, Will +15", "Melee": "bite +24 (2d10+13), 2 claws +24 (2d6+13)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., burrow 10 ft., climb 40 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Huge"}
