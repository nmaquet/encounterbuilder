It is an incredibly dangerous predator, a creature of immense strength that uses its keen intellect and deadly <i>poison</i> to stalk and kill its prey. Its natural form is that of an huge scorpion, but it can also assume an armored humanoid shape suitable for stealth or interacting with Norgorber's followers. Though its main purpose for coming to Golarion is to kill, it has also been called to aid great thefts and bury terrible secrets. The Stabbing Beast enjoys the company of mortals in the same way that a well-fed barn cat enjoys the company of mice. It sometimes \"plays\" with these toys, teaching them secrets of alchemy or assassination, though it just as often maims or kills them as it sees fit or according to Norgorber's greater plans. It ignores most creatures as if they were unimportant or not even alive, bowling over these irrelevant people in its way and casually murdering those who make nuisances of themselves. <b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> The Stabbing Beast is guilty of thousands of killings and has no fear of death. It does not believe that anything other than its master can kill it, despite mortal records showing that it has been killed in the past; Norgorber wiped its memory of these failures when he resurrected his herald. Norgorber's herald is normally emotionless and cold, showing no remorse or regret for any death or injury. When the cult of Norgorber summons the Stabbing Beast, the mortals may present it with several choice targets to hunt and slay, though predicting its interests is difficult and the Beast may select its own target-or none at all- in exchange for its services. The Beast keeps trophies of its kills by covering the corpses in a preservative bile, swallowing them in its scorpion form, and regurgitating them when it returns to its lair deep beneath the planar metropolis of Axis. <b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> The herald of Norgorber lives only to serve his dark master, whose mandates may come to the Stabbing Beast in a steady stream of evil deeds or sporadically and with long periods of dormancy between. When idle for too long, it tends to turn off its mind and simply waits in stasis, completely inert like a clockwork device that has run down. It reacts to prayers to Norgorber as if they were echoes of its master's voice, drawing its attention without violence and bringing it to full alertness.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Infernal, Protean; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "AP 59", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "16", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(18d10+126)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 32, Dex 31, Con 24, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "poison stream +26 touch (blindness)", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3176, "SubType": "(evil, extraplanar, shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Deflect ArrowsB, Dodge, Greater FeintB, Improved FeintB, Improved Initiative, Improved Iron Will, Iron Will, Mobility, Skill Focus (Stealth), Spring Attack, Two-Weapon FightingB", "AlternateNameForm": "Scorpion Form", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "18", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Bluff, +4 Perception, +8 Stealth (+16 in forests)", "AC": "31, touch 19, flat-footed 20", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Stabbing Beast", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Appraise +13, Bluff +22, Climb +20, Craft (alchemy) +13, Knowledge (arcana) +10, Knowledge (local) +13, Knowledge (nature) +10, Knowledge (planes) +13, Knowledge (religion) +13,Perception +27, Sense Motive +14, Stealth +37 (+45 in forests)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "15", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any land or urban", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "change shape (Huge scorpion or scorpion-tailed human), murderer's reward", "Saves": "Fort +18, Ref +16, Will +15; +4 vs. mind-affecting", "Melee": "2 claws +27 (2d6+12/19-20 plus bleed and grab), sting +27 (2d6+12/19-20 plus bleed and poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Huge"}
