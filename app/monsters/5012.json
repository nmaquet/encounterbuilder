The rain of asps functions as a venomous snake swarm (see below). </h5><h5><b>Despair (Su)</b> All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see an asp mummy must make a DC 18 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same asp mummy's despair ability for one day. This is a paralysis and a mind-affecting fear affect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Mummy Rot (Su)</b> Curse and disease-slam; save DC 18 Fort; <i>onset</i> 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure -. Mummy rot is both a curse and disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element of mummy rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted creature must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from mummy rot turns to dust and cannot be raised without a <i>resurrection</i> or greater magic. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Snake Bite-injury; <i>save</i> DC 20 Fort; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d3 Con damage; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive <i>save</i>s. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. </h5><h5><b>Writhing Snakes (Ex)</b> When a creature adjacent to an asp mummy makes a melee attack against it, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Reflex save or be subjected to the asp mummy's poison as the many snakes slithering in and out of the its bandages spring and bite. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Similar in many respects to standard mummies, asp mummies are created to guard tombs of regal kings and nobles. Some believe these creatures even have a spark of the divine mixed in with their creation and are appointed by the gods themselves to watch over their favored followers. Asp mummies are known to be favored as guardians among the followers of Set. The creation of an asp mummy follows the same procedure as a standard mummy, save that many small asps are placed into the hollowed corpse along with the herbs and flowers.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or court (3-6)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(10d8+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 26, Dex 10, Con -, Int 8, Wis 15, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5012, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Iron Will, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness, Weapon Focus (slam)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "6", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth", "AC": "22, touch 10, flat-footed 22", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Asp Mummy", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Intimidate +16, Perception +21, Stealth +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "11", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +6, Ref +3, Will +11", "Melee": "slam +16 (2d6+8 plus mummy rot), snakes +10 (1d6+8 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Medium"}
