Any creature that attacks a frost worm with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of cold damage per successful hit. A creature that grapples or is grappled by a frost worm takes 4d6 points of cold damage per round the grapple is maintained. </h5><h5><b>Death Throes (Su)</b> When killed, a frost worm explodes in a 100-foot-radius burst that deals 12d6 cold damage and 8d6 piercing damage (DC 23 Reflex half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Trill (Su)</b> As a full-round action, a frost worm can emit a strange trilling sound that affects all creatures within a 100-foot radius. Creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be fascinated for as long as the worm continues to trill (the frost worm can maintain this trill by concentrating). Once a creature has resisted or broken the effect, it cannot be affected again by that same frost worm's trill for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>With armor-crushing jaws, flesh that radiates cold, and a terrible keening cry capable of holding creatures fascinated, frost worms are apex predators of the frozen tundra and glaciers. In the frost worms' far-reaching hunting grounds, they fear only the remorhaz, for the heat generated by an enraged remorhaz causes intense pain to a frost worm.</p><p>This extreme aversion to heat, as well as its freezing touch and devastating breath weapon, stems from an unusual facet of frost worm physiology-veins that run with magically cold blood. This creature's ichor is clear, but infused with such sub-freezing temperatures that the monster's flesh can freeze water in the skin of creatures that touch it. When a frost worm dies, this magical energy dissipates, and both blood and muscle immediately freeze solid and then explode into a catastrophic barrage of icy shrapnel. As a result, even those predators that might legitimately prey upon the burrowing monstrosities tend to leave frost worms well enough alone.</p><p>An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "13", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(16d10+80)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 31, Dex 16, Con 21, Int 2, Wis 16, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1224, "SubType": "(cold)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception), Stand Still, Weapon Focus (bite)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in ice and snow", "AC": "27, touch 11, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Frost Worm", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +17, Stealth +6 (+14 in ice and snow)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "12", "XP": 19200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold plains or mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "cold", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +13, Will +10", "Melee": "bite +25 (4d10+15 plus 4d6 cold)", "Burrow": "1", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., burrow 10 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
