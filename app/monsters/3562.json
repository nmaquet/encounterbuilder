Equipped with ratlike prehensile tails, monkey goblins are as at home in the trees as they are on the ground. Monkey goblins lead a savage lifestyle, and many take levels in the barbarian class, though warriors and fighters are also common among the race. While spellcasting classes are almost unheard of among them, monkey goblin shamans in the service of demon lords or other dark gods are given a respect by other monkey goblins that borders on fear. <br><b>MONKEY GOBLIN CHARACTERS (10 RP)</b><br> Monkey goblins are defined by their class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice.
