It is omnivorous and rarely makes its home near civilized or settled areas. Each of the creature's tusks, if wholly pried from a dead oliphant, brings 400 gp on the market. The oliphant's fur is thick, brown, and aids in protecting it from cooler climates and precipitation. Oliphants are sometimes trained as mounts or beasts of burden by various humanoid races. Oliphants seem to understand Common, but they do not speak it.</p><p>An oliphant attacks with its downward curving tusks and heavy forelegs; its trunk is too short to be used as an effective weapon.<br><b>Training an Oliphant</b><br> An oliphant requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, an oliphant must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly oliphant requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding an oliphant does not require an exotic saddle. An oliphant can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p><p>Oliphant young are worth 2,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train an oliphant.<br><b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for an oliphant is up to 2,400 pounds; a medium load, 2,401-4,800 pounds; and a heavy load, 4,801-7,200 pounds. An oliphant can drag 36,000 pounds.</p><p>Credit The Oliphant originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>EX2 Land Beyond the Magic Mirror</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary (male), family unit (2-8, 25% chance to be accompanied by a calf if 3 or more are encountered)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(9d8+45)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 11, Con 21, Int 6, Wis 15, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "animal", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3483, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Diehard, Endurance, Improved Iron Will, Intimidating Prowess, Iron Will", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 8, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Oliphant", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Intimidate +11, Perception +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +6, Will +7", "Melee": "gore +13 (2d8+13), 2 stamps +13 (2d6+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
