The effects last for 1 minute before the weather in the area returns to normal.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Stormwardens dwell high in the mountains and hills away from civilization. They are hunters by nature and spend their time hunting and trapping game, though they never do so to an abundance, only enough to sustain themselves. They are isolationists and solitary, rarely found in groups of more than 6 individuals. Their hair color and eye color range across the spectrum just as a normal human, though most tend to have dark hair and eyes.</p><p>Stormwardens prefer to avoid combat, but if provoked, they open combat using their longswords, attempting to slay their opponents before escaping to their lair. If melee goes against a stormwarden, it alters the weather and attempts to escape.</p><p><br><b>Stormwarden Characters</b><br> Stormwardens favor nature-oriented classes, such as druid and ranger.</p><p>They do not worship a single deity above all others, though they do tend to favor deities of storms and destruction. Though relatively few in number, stormwarden witches have a reputation of being some of the blackest and most vile practitioners of that art.<br><b>+2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom.</b><br><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> Stormwardens can see twice as far as humans in dim light.<br><b>Racial Hit Dice:</b> A stormwarden begins with three levels of humanoid, which provide 3d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +3, and Will +1.<br><b>Racial Skills:</b> A stormwarden's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 2 x (2 + Int modifier).<br><b>Racial Feats:</b> A stormwarden's humanoid levels give it two feats, typically Improved Initiative and Skill Focus (Perception).<br><b>AC:</b> +1 natural armor bonus.<br><b>Special Attacks:</b> Conjure storm (see above).<br><b>Languages:</b> Stormwardens begin play speaking Common, and can select bonus languages from the following: Aklo, Auran, Draconic, Elven, Giant, and Sylvan.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Draconic, Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-6)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d8+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 10, Con 12, Int 15, Wis 13, Cha 10", "Gear": "leather armor, longsword, longbow, 20 arrows", "Ranged": "longbow +2 (1d8)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3037, "SubType": "(stormwarden)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "13, touch 11, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Stormwarden", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +3, Knowledge (any one) +5, Perception +7, Survival +7", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate mountains", "CharacterFlag": "1", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +3, Will +2", "Melee": "longsword +3 (1d8+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
