In appearance, they resemble man-sized, bipedal badgers. They are a battlehardened race, warring mostly with elves or centaurs, and many ryvens carry the scars of such battles with pride.</p><p>Ryven prefer to battle with their natural weapons, relying on their claws and fangs to down their foes. Some carry weapons, usually short swords, daggers, and light crossbows. More insidious ryven sometimes coat their weapons or crossbow bolts with death adder poison.</p><p>Ryvens prefer to attack from surprise. Often, a ryven burrows underneath an unsuspecting foe and emerges from the ground in a blast of rock and dirt, catching the opponent by surprise.</p><p>It then tears into its opponent with teeth and claws.</p><p>Ryven have managed to gain some control over their animalistic behavior and when angered and raging, can attempt to end the rage.<b></p><p>Ryven Society</b></p><p> Ryven are tribal folk and build large burrows and tunnels that travel deep into the ground. Leaders are always the strongest and largest of a tribe. Tribes rarely number more than 20 creatures, so it is not uncommon to find more than one tribe sharing the same burrow.</p><p>Ryvens are carnivores and actively hunt sources of meat. Favorite meals include sheep, goat, deer, and reptiles such as snakes, especially vipers.</p><p>Ryvens are not adverse to eating humanoid flesh and sometimes dine on captured enemies. They consume massive quantities of meat, much more than one would normally expect a creature of their size and stature to consume, so most tribes keep a ready supply of meat handy. They are nocturnal creatures so most encounters occur at night. Raiding parties also conduct their business at night, seeking out those who would camp or sleep too close to the ryven's lair. Such unfortunates are either robbed or killed, or both. The goods and gear of slain foes are carried back to the burrow and stored. If the raiding party is also on a hunting excursion, slain foes are likewise carried back to the lair and stored until they are eaten.</p><p>Entrances and exits to a ryven burrow are well camouflaged so enemies and predators cannot locate easily them. Each burrow consists of many interlocking passageways (most large enough to allow the ryvens to walk upright) and chambers. Such chambers function as living quarters, storage, battle grounds, or temples for the tribe. Temples are considered highly sacred places to a ryven tribe and are always well-protected and guarded. Most ryven tribes keep company with badgers or dire badgers.<br><b>Ryvens as Characters</b><br><b>+4 Strength, +6 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, -4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom</b>.
