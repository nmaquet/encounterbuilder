In civilized lands they are considered a nuisance for the damage they cause, especially in larger groups, to crops and farmlands. If faced with extreme hunger, stench beetles eat cattle, small game animals, and the occasional child that wanders too far into the forests. Stench beetles make their lairs in large hollow logs and fallen trees. A typical lair can contain almost twenty of these creatures with half that number in noncombatant young. Females lay up to a dozen eggs at a given time, usually once per year. Eggs are laid on leaves, and the female chews the ends of the leaves so it curls and folds around the eggs, concealing them from predators and protecting the eggs from the elements. Young go from larvae to adulthood in the span of a year. When they reach adulthood most stench beetles leave the lair. Stench beetles attack with their bite, seeking retreat if combat goes against them.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "cluster (3-6) or colony (7-16)", "Ref": "0", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 11, Con 11, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "vermin", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4744, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "14, touch 11, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Stench Beetle", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly -2", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "0", "Race": "", "CR": "1/2", "XP": 200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests or plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +0, Will +0", "Melee": "bite +2 (1d4)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 30 ft.
