These creatures are extremely territorial and are never encountered with others of their kind. Mating habits among lurkers is unknown to sages as no two of these creatures have ever been encountered together. A typical lurker above has a hunting territory of several square miles.</p><p>A lurker above waits for its prey, clinging to the ceiling, roof, or other such overhang. When prey passes beneath it, the lurker above drops from its hiding place and wraps itself around its prey.<br><b>Lurker Below</b><br> The lurker below is an aquatic variety of lurker above that makes its lair in any body of water and in any climate (though it rarely lairs in extremely cold climates). Lurkers below are pale blue or black in color and are often mistaken for giant manta rays. Lurkers below cannot fly, but have a swim speed of 40 feet. They are otherwise identical to their landbased counterparts detailed above.</p><p>Credit The Lurker Above originally appeared in the <i>Strategic Review #3</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1975) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(10d8+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 30, Dex 12, Con 19, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2787, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Blind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception), Skill Focus (Stealth)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth (+12 in rocky areas)", "AC": "19, touch 9, flat-footed 18", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lurker Above", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +23, Fly +1, Perception +12, Stealth +8 (+16 in rocky areas)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +4, Will +9", "Melee": "slam +15 (3d8+15 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., climb 5 ft., fly 40 ft.
