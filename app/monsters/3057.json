This allows the tangtal to create up to eight images of itself. The images can move up to 30 feet away from the tangtal, but each must be within 10 feet of another image. The tangtal can use this ability once per day and it otherwise resembles the <i>mirror image</i> spell.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Tangtals, or dupli-cats, are ferocious and intelligent panthers with the ability to produce illusory images of themselves. They roam haunted woodlands or plains and often lair near civilized areas.</p><p>Tangtals are solitary creatures; no recorded encounter has ever placed more than one of these creatures together. Mating season is the only time more than one of these creatures is likely to be encountered and sages have argued as to exactly when tangtals mate. Tangtal young are unknown and none have ever been seen.</p><p>Tangtals are carnivores and prefer to dine on small animals such as rats, moles, squirrels, and so on. In such instances when food is scarce, it is not unheard of for a tangtal to sneak into a civilized area and carry off or kill chickens, hens, dogs, cats, and even small children. A tangtal is about 7 feet long from nose to tail and weighs about 350 to 400 pounds.</p><p>Tangtals wait for prey to come within range before leaping to attack with their wicked bite and sharpened claws. They use their duplicate ability as a defense mechanism against larger or stronger foes, or when they're outnumbered. Tangtals are smart enough to know when the day is lost, and if combat goes against them, they flee.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d6+10)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 19, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3057, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "Dupli-cat", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 14, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Tangtal", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +8, Stealth +9", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests and plains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "duplicate", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +7, Will +2", "Melee": "bite +7 (1d6+3), 2 claws +7 (1d4+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
