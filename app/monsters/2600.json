The two races share some strong similarities, and at first sight inexperienced adventurers could easily confuse the two. Flinds are much stockier than their lanky kin, much stronger and hardier, and are certainly more dangerous.</p><p>It is unknown if flinds are a subspecies of the gnoll or a genetic anomaly produced among large gnoll packs. Flinds are often found among gnoll bands acting as leaders, as their strength and relatively superior intelligence puts them above their lesser brethren.</p><p>Flind combat tactics are similar to those of gnolls. They prefer to strike from ambush, using terrain and concealment to their best advantage.</p><p>They are most often seen acting in the role of leaders to gnoll bands, keeping discipline with a ruthless hand and little mercy.</p><p><br></br><b>Flind Characters</b><br></br> Flind leaders are always fighters. Flind clerics usually worship the Demon Prince of Gnolls and can choose two of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, and Trickery. All flinds have the following racial traits <br><b>+8 Str, +4 Dex;, +6 Con, +2 Int, +4 Wis, +2 Cha</b>: Flinds are exceptional gnolls, and excel in all areas over their lesser kin.<br><b>Darkvision</b>: Flinds cans see in the dark out to 60 feet.<br><b>Armor</b>: Flinds have a +1 natural armor bonus.<br><b>Racial Hit Dice</b>: A flind begins with two levels of humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0.<br><b>Racial Skills</b>: A flind's humanoid levels give it skill rank equal to 2 x (2 + Int modifier).<br><b>Racial Feats</b>: A flind's humanoid levels give it one feat.<br><b>Automatic Languages</b>: Gnoll. Bonus Languages: Common, Draconic, Goblin, Orc.<br><b>Weapon Proficiency</b>: Flinds are automatically proficient with the flindbar.<br><b>Flindbar</b><br> The wielder of a flindbar gains a +2 bonus on disarm attempts made with the weapon. Flindbars are otherwise identical to nunchaku. Anyone proficient with nunchaku is also proficient with flindbars.</p><p> Credit The Flind originally appeared in the First Edition Fiend Folio (\u00a9 TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by J.
