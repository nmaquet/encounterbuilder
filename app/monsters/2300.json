This attack is swift enough to attack running or flying creatures. A cave moray's recoil attack is always considered a charge attack since it recoils into its cyst after an attack to lunge at its opponent again.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Cave morays make their lairs underground in abandoned mines, dungeons, or natural occurring caves, usually near corridors, hallways or other areas of high traffic. Its lair is a burrow, just large enough for its body dug into the walls. Only one cave moray inhabits each burrow.</p><p>A typical cave moray cluster contains an equal number of males and females, while a colony is often contains more females than males.</p><p>Even so, the male cave moray dominates the colony. Mating occurs in the warmer months of the year with a gestation period of about 6 months. Young are born live and depend completely on their mother for nourishment and food until they are about 8 months old.</p><p>A cave moray is a carnivore and its diet consists of whatever it can kill. Prey is devoured immediately and never stored or saved for later. A typical adult cave moray can go a month or more without eating.</p><p>A cave moray's favored tactic is to lie in wait in its cyst-like burrow in the wall and attack whenever prey passes nearby. Two or more cave morays usually strike in unison, one from each side of a passage. After an attack, a cave moray recoils into its cyst to strike again.</p><p>Credit The Cave Moray originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.
