A creature reduced to Dex 0 is turned to crystal (as the <i>stone to flesh</i> spell) permanently if it fails a DC 25 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus from the crysolax's Ability Focus feat. </h5><h5><b>Scintillating Aura (Ex)</b> As long as there is a light source present within 30 feet of it, the crysolax constantly radiates an aura that duplicates the effects of a <i>rainbow pattern</i> spell (CL 15th). The save is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A terrifying predator native to the Plane of Earth (and also a pocket dimension known as the Demiplane of Crystal), the crysolax is a hunter, active most often during the daylight hours. During the day, natural sunlight refracts from the crysolax causing it to appear to be a multitude of different colors. It uses this natural sunlight to activate its aura when hunting or in combat. A crysolax spends its days hunting creatures native to the Plane of Earth, while at night, the creature is usually found in its lair, a large and complex maze of twisting corridors, caverns, and spiraling tunnels located deep within the rocky earth of its native plane. A crysolax lair usually consists of 2-4 adults and twice that number in smaller noncombatant crysolax. The female lays 4-8 large crystal eggs usually once per year. These eggs usually hatch within 60 days and a crysolax reaches maturity within two years. Its lair is also scattered with any treasure it may have gathered. Though not a creature known for collecting treasure, a crysolax is quite fond of gemstones, and as such a large amount of said treasure usually can be found in its lair. While a crysolax has no need to eat, some do enjoy ingesting certain gemstone (the exact type seems to vary between each crysolax). A crysolax attacks with its bite, attempting to petrify the strongest opponents first. It also rakes and slashes with its razor-sharp claws or grabs a foe and repeatedly subjects it to its bite attack, knowing that eventually the victim will succumb to its petrifying nature.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Terran", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or carat (2-4)", "Ref": "12", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(15d10+90)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 27, Dex 16, Con 22, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4772, "SubType": "(earth, elemental, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Ability Focus (petrifying bite), Alertness, Improved Critical (claw), Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (claw), Great Fortitude, Vital Strike", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "17", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "27, touch 11, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Crysolax", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +21, Climb +26, Escape Artist +21, Knowledge (planes) +19, Perception +24, Sense Motive +4, Stealth +13, Survival +20", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "15", "XP": 51200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Earth)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +17, Ref +12, Will +7", "Melee": "2 claws +22 (1d8+8/19-20 plus grab), bite +21 (2d6+8 plus 1d6 Dex damage)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "50 ft.", "Alignment": "LE", "Size": "Huge"}
