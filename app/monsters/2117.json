Having given up their humanoid bodies in favor of the more stealthy and wretched guise of a singular large eye armored in bloodied metal plates, augurs act as spies and sycophants for more powerful kytons. Their miniscule size, sturdy exterior, and unnerving gazes make them ideally equipped for dangerous reconnaissance missions to the Material Plane, where the augurs are able to scout out potential raiding locations or spot vulnerable, lone travelers before their more powerful kyton brethren cross the planes to attack. While their usefulness in tasks of stealth and guile makes augurs deadly companions, their insatiable lust for blood often proves their ultimate downfall. Augurs, like most kytons, find themselves in a heightened state of arousal when witness to the destruction of flesh, but the extent to which these muscular orbs find pleasure in blood is far more treacherous than their more disciplined peers. Many augurs cannot help but indulge themselves when exposed to gore-rolling within and dipping their blades into freshly spilled pools-an unfortunate trait which has led many careless augurs to their capture or doom. An augur's gruesome appearance is not always self-inflicted. They are sometimes constructed by other kytons who seek to impose an everlasting punishment upon a particularly unwilling mortal sacrifice; the defiant individual's body is cast aside for scraps as its mind and soul are transferred into the monocular shell, producing an augur when the ritual is complete. Augurs are the least pragmatic type of all kytons, and thus the least respected among their peers. The condemnation of an individual's spirit to the cage-like body of a kyton augur is the precedent for a truly agonizing and lonely existence. A lawful evil spellcaster can gain an augur as a familiar at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat. A typical augur kyton is 1 foot in diameter and weighs 30 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Infernal (cannot speak)", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 3", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, pack (3-5), or squad (6-8)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 8, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 12, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2117, "SubType": "(evil, extraplanar, kyton, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 15, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Augur", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +4, Escape Artist +9, Fly +11, Intimidate +4, Perception +7, Sense Motive +7, Sleight of Hand +9, Stealth +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Plane of Shadow)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +8, Will +4", "Melee": "gore +4 (1d4-1 plus bleed)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., fly 50 ft.
