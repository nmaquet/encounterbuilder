No animal, wild or domesticated, approaches within 30 feet of a marked foe; if forced to do so, the creature panics and remains so as long as it's within 30 feet of the target. The mark can be removed by a <i>break enchantment</i> or <i>dispel magic</i> (the latter of which must be cast by a spellcaster whose caster level is equal to or higher than the valeany's Hit Dice). Dryads, druids, and valeanys can sense a marked creature within 60 feet. </h5><h5><b>Nature's Empathy (Su)</b> This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy class feature, except the valeany has a +4 racial bonus on the check. The valeany's effective druid level is equal to her Hit Dice for determining her total modifier to the check.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The valeany or \"forest girl\" is thought to be distantly related to the dryad and nymph. She makes her home deep in a secluded area of a forest, not far from civilized areas perhaps but secluded enough that it is away from prying eyes. Valeanys are free-spirited creatures that enjoy games, frivolity, and nature. They are often found in the company of dryads, nymphs, sirines, and elves. A valeany appears as a comely human female with long flowing golden hair that nearly reaches the ground. The eyes of a valeany are a deep golden blue or brown. Skin color ranges from light golden to dark tan. The valeany wears either lightly colored and lightweight gowns or nothing at all. Valeany, like their cousins the dryad and nymph, are not combatants. They seek to avoid combat when possible, unless they themselves, their homes, or their allies are threatened or harmed. Most often, a valeany uses its spell-like abilities to slip away from battle as soon as possible, marking its enemies as it does so. If forced into combat, a valeany fights using its spell-like abilities and embrace. Incapacitated or weakened foes are left where they fall.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d6+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 19, Con 15, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 19", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5092, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 15, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Valeany", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +11, Diplomacy +11, Handle Animal +8, Knowledge (nature) +9, Perception +9, Sense Motive +9, Stealth +11, Survival +6", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "nature's empathy", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +8, Will +6", "Melee": "mwk dagger +7 (1d4/19-20) or touch +6 (mark) or unarmed +6 (1d3 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Medium"}
