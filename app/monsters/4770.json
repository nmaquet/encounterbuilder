They spend most of their days mining, collecting minerals, or simply enjoying the natural beauty of their surroundings. Conshee don't take intrusions <i>light</i>ly and are moved to anger quickly when their homes are threatened. The conshee have an intense dislike for mites (see the <i>Tome of Horrors</i> Complete) and generally attack them on sight. Captured mites are killed almost immediately; very rarely are they ever taken prisoner. Mites seem to dislike the conshee equally as much, though captured conshee are often kept as slaves or sold back to their conshee clan or family. Conshee prefer ambush tactics to straight-forward combat, attacking at range with their short bows and spell-like abilities. Some conshee also use daggers, saps, and other such weapons, allowing them to attack quickly and often times unnoticed. Conshee also employ a wide array of traps, snares, and pitfalls to injure, confuse, or capture would-be opponents. The corridors and passages leading to a conshee lair are often rife with all manner of such traps and pitfalls. Conshee often employ natural poisons as well, taken from the various plants, leaves, and underground flowers near their lairs. An adult conshee stands about 2 feet tall. It is a small lithe creature with grayish skin, a hairless body, and two leathery bat-like wings growing from its back. Its hands end in claws, though they are not strong enough to use in combat.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "troop (3-6), band (7-12), or swarm (13-22)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d6)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 6, Dex 15, Con 11, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "short bow +4 (1d3-2)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4770, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "0", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 14, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Conshee", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Bluff +5, Diplomacy +5, Escape Artist +6, Fly +18, Perception +7, Sleight of Hand +6, Stealth +14", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "1/3", "XP": 135, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +0, Ref +4, Will +3", "Melee": "dagger +0 (1d2-2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 50 ft.
