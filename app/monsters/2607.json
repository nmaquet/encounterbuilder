Once the affected metal reaches the searing stage (after 3 rounds), it remains at that stage until the forlarren is killed, moves more than 100 feet from the target, or dismisses the effect (as a free action). Once the effect has been dismissed, the metal slowly returns to its normal temperature (just as in the spell). The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The powers of a nymph are such that she can enchant and seduce nearly any creature that has the capacity to know beauty. Some say that even the great and terrible daemons are not immune to a nypmh's charms. The forlarren, they say, is the proof. The forlarren is a lonely creature that feels cursed by its own existence. They detest themselves and everything they see, consumed by hatred of life itself. Such is their rage that they seek to vent their ire on good and evil alike.</p><p>A forlarren stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds.</p><p>The forlarren attacks with its fists, using them to pummel an opponent. It focuses on a single opponent in combat and attacks until it or its opponent is slain. If a forlarren succeeds in killing an opponent, the kindly traits of its fey mother surface and it shows profound remorse. It ceases combat, if possible, or flees if other opponents insist on continuing the fight. Should its opponents allow combat to end, the forlarren may offer its solace to the surviving companions amid wails and sobs. After a few days, however, the dominant evil nature of its fiendish father resurfaces and the forlarren once more attacks all creatures on sight-including those it had previously befriended.</p><p>Credit The Forlarren originally appeared in the First Edition <i>Fiend Folio</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Ian Livingstone.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Forlarren, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d6+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2607, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "2", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "18, touch 12, flat-footed 26", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Forlarren", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +10, Stealth +8, Survival +4", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any temperate land", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +2, Ref +5, Will +4", "Melee": "2 slams +3 (1d4+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Medium"}
