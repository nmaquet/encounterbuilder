If the hood's attack succeeds, it can immediately make a grapple check to grab its target and constrict. The hood's crawling tendrils wrap themselves tightly around its victim, seeking entry into the creature's ears, nose, and throat, making it difficult to remove. Any attacks against the hood deal half damage to the hood and its grappled target inside. </h5><h5><b>Strangle (Ex)</b> A grappling executioner's hood entirely covers its opponent's head with an airtight grip. A creature that is grappled by the hood cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see Suffocation, <i>Pathfinder Core</i> Rulebook) unless it doesn't speak or breathe through its head. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Alcohol (Ex)</b> Strong alcohol harms the hood. Every quart poured on it causes 1 point of damage. Four quarts of alcohol incapacitates it and forces it to release a grappled target.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The executioner's hood is a deadly monster, black in color and 1 inch thick, that resembles an actual executioner's hood or a small black bag.</p><p>It has two eyeholes that can be used to see into or out of the monster (if some unfortunate soul happens actually to pick it up-or worse, put it on).</p><p>The executioner's hood is sometimes used to guard valuable belongings.</p><p>It does so unerringly as long as a constant supply of food is available.</p><p>The executioner's hood clings to the ceiling, waiting for prey to pass under it. When prey passes by, the hood drops and attempts to engulf the victim's head. Slain victims are slowly devoured by the hood.</p><p>Credit The Executioner's Hood originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>EX1</i> <i>Dungeonland</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Copyright Notice </b>Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(2d8+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 12, Con 12, Int 3, Wis 13, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2584, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Executioner's Hood", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +8, Perception +8, Stealth +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +1, Will +4", "Melee": "slam +3 (1d4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., climb 5 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Tiny"}
