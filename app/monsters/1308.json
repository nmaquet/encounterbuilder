When a nightwing bites a foe, the victim must make a DC 23 Will save or one spell effect currently affecting him immediately ends-determine which spell is drained randomly if the target is under the effects of more than one spell. The nightwing heals damage equal to twice the level of the spell drained-hit points in excess of its maximum are instead gained as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. If a nightwing attempts to sunder a magic item with its bite, its magic-draining bite renders the item nonmagical for 1d4 rounds (if the item is a permanent magic item), drains 1d8 charges (if the item has charges), or renders it permanently nonmagical (if the item is a one-use item). The item (or its wielder, if the item is attended) can resist this effect with a DC 23 Will save. Damage dealt to an item is applied after the effects of magic drain are applied. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The least of the known types of nightshade, the nightwing is nevertheless a deadly foe. Nightwings often serve more powerful nightshades as aerial support. These nightshades are also the most likely to be found serving a non-undead master-nightwings are often used by powerful mortals as guardians or sentinels. Despite this, nightwings still hope to someday slay any master they serve. They enter servitude primarily as a method of aiding a destructive or murderous mortal in their task of mass murder; once this task is over, or if at any point the nightwing believes its master is slacking in its murderous duties, the nightwing is swift to turn on its one-time ally. A nightwing found on the Material Plane not in the employ of a more powerful master is typically encountered in rugged terrain where there are numerous locations that can provide shelter when the sun rises. The monsters prefer caves and abandoned buildings for this purpose. A nightwing's body is 20 feet long, but its wingspan is 80 feet. It weighs 4,500 pounds.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or flight (3-6)", "Ref": "11", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(17d8+119)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 31, Dex 18, Con -, Int 18, Wis 21, Cha 21", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1308, "SubType": "(extraplanar, nightshade)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Command Undead, Great Cleave, Improved Critical (bite), Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Snatch", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in dim light and darkness", "AC": "29, touch 12, flat-footed 25", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Nightwing", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Fly +24, Knowledge (arcana) +24, Knowledge (religion) +24, Perception +25, Sense Motive +25, Spellcraft +24, Stealth +16 (+24 in darkness), Swim +27", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "17", "Race": "", "CR": "14", "XP": 38400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Negative Energy Plane)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +11, Will +17", "Melee": "bite +23 (4d10+18/19- 20 plus 4d6 cold and magic drain)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.
