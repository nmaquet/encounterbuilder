A creature struck must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or gain 2d4 negative levels. Even on a successful save, the victim gains 1d4 negative levels. Assuming the target survives, it regains lost levels after 11 hours have passed. Negative levels from a necromantic golem do not have a chance of becoming permanent. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. </h5><h5><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</b> A necromantic golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: A magical attack that heals living creatures <i>slow</i>s a necromantic golem (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). A magical attack that deals negative energy damage breaks any <i>slow</i> effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A necromantic golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal negative energy damage. A <i>raise dead</i> spell deals 6d6 points of damage to a necromantic golem. A necromantic golem gets no saving throw against this effect. A <i>resurrection</i> or true <i>resurrection</i> spell negates its DR and immunity to magic for 1 minute. In an area affected by a <i>hallow</i> spell, a necromantic golem takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, checks, and saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. In areas affected by an un<i>hallow</i> spell, a necromantic golem gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, checks, and saves, and a +2 bonus to AC. </h5><h5><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> A necromantic golem heals 1 hit point every hour up to its maximum hit points. If reduced to 0 hit points or less, the golem continues to heal. A necromantic golem can be permanently destroyed by reducing it to 0 hit points or less, casting a <i>hallow</i> spell on the corpse, and dousing the golem with holy water. </h5><h5><b>Unholy Blast (Su)</b> As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, a necromantic golem can unleash a blast of negative take 6d6 points of negative energy damage (good-aligned outsiders caught in the area take 6d8 points of negative energy damage). A DC 15 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>A necromantic golem resembles a flesh golem, and is often times mistaken for said creature. It is assembled in much the same way as a flesh golem is (humanoid body parts stitched together into a single form), and infused with negative energy during the construction process. A necromantic golem stands 8 feet tall and weighs around 500 pounds. Its sickly greenish flesh is drawn tight around its frame in areas and rotted completely away in others. Its form weeps fluids from various sores and injuries. A necromantic golem wields no weapons and wears whatever its creator gives it, usually ragged clothing and nothing more. A necromantic golem cannot speak, though it does seem to understand basic commands spoken in the Common tongue. In combat, a necromantic golem attacks with its unholy blast and powerful slam attacks, usually opening battle with its enervating ray. It is relentless and fights to the death unless otherwise instructed by its creator. A necromantic golem moves and walks with a stiff gait. <br><b>Construction</b><br> The pieces of a necromantic golem must come from normal humanoid corpses that have not decayed significantly. Assembly requires a minimum of six different bodies-one for each limb, the torso (including head), and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also required. Note that creating a necromantic golem requires casting a spell with the evil descriptor. <br><b>NECROMANTIC GOLEM</b> <br><b>CL</b> 10th; <b>Price</b> 24,500 gp </h5><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION </b> </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>animate dead</i>, <i>bull's strength</i>, <i>enervation</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, creator must be caster level 10th; <b>Skill</b> Craft (leather) or Heal DC 15; <b>Cost</b> 12,000 gp</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d10+30)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 18, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4964, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 9, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Necromantic Golem", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "8", "XP": 4800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "rejuvenation", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +4", "Melee": "2 slams +14 (2d6+4 plus 1d6 negative energy)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Large"}
