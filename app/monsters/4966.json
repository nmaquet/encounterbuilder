In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: <i>Warp wood</i> or <i>wood shape</i> slows a skiff golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the skiff golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A skiff golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal cold damage. <i>Repel wood</i> drives the skiff golem back 30 feet and deals 2d12 points of damage to it (no save). <i>Ironwood</i> heals a skiff golem of all its lost hit points. </h5><h5><b>Man Overboard (Ex)</b> A skiff golem can rock itself violently back and forth as a move action, causing all those onboard to fall into the water (which if on the River Styx could be a very bad thing indeed). A creature can attempt to maintain its footing and grab onto the skiff golem by succeeding on a DC 27 Acrobatics check. The check DC is Strength-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Crafted by Charon, the Boatman of the Lower Planes and his servants, these creatures serve as an automated means of transportation across the Styx. A rider's destination need merely be whispered in the golem's ear and payment dropped into a nearby container on the skiff. When these conditions are met, the skiff sets out immediately at full speed, polling across water and land alike with otherworldly determination. If attacked, or if travelers attempt to board the skiff without first paying, a skiff golem attacks with its ebon staff and breath weapon (the skeletal figure pivots to face its opponents). If it manages to paralyze an opponent with its staff, it attempts to knock that foe from its skiff into the waiting waters. If threatened with destruction, the skiff golem summons several charonadaemons to its aid or makes haste to retreat, poling thru rock, stone, magical obstructions, water and fire if necessary. <br><b>Construction</b><br> The construction of a skiff golem is a closely guarded secret, known only to Charon and some of his most loyal servants.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Infernal (cannot speak any)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(15d10+40)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 31, Dex 6, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 11", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4966, "SubType": "(extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "21, touch 6, flat-footed 21", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Skiff Golem", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Swim +18", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (lower planes)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +3, Will +5", "Melee": "quarterstaff +23/+18/+13 (2d6+15 plus paralysis)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., swim 50 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
