Opponents in the affected area must succeed on a DC 26 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking 2d8+15 points of bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the creature moves off them. If the creature chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Strength-based. </h5><h5><b>Ethereal Ambush (Ex)</b> A dimensional slug that attacks foes on the Material Plane in a surprise round can take a full round of actions if it begins the combat by phasing into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane. </h5><h5><b>Ethereal Jaunt (Su)</b> A dimensional slug can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or as part of a move action). The ability is otherwise identical to <i>ethereal jaunt</i> (CL 15th). </h5><h5><b>Spit Acid (Ex)</b> A dimensional slug can spit acid at an opponent within 60 feet (no range increment). With a successful ranged touch attack, the target takes 12d6 points of acid damage (no save). </h5><h5><b>Malleable (Ex)</b> A dimensional slug's body is very malleable, allowing it to fit into narrow areas with ease. A dimensional slug takes no penalty to its speed or checks when squeezing in an area that is one size category smaller than its actual size (10 feet wide for most dimensional slugs). A dimensional slug can squeeze normally through an area two size categories smaller than its actual size (5 feet wide for most dimensional slugs). </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Salt (Ex)</b> A handful of salt burns a dimensional slug as if the salt were a flask of acid, causing 1d6 points of damage per use.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Dimensional slugs are offshoots of giant slugs that now dwell in the Ethereal Plane. They feed upon the detritus, which is sometimes drawn into the ether, and occasionally shift themselves into the Material Plane to feed. These creatures detest phase spiders and attack them on sight. A dimensional slug commonly attacks by spraying acid and crushing its opponents. If combat is going poorly for a dimensional slug, it shifts back to the Ethereal Plane.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(12d10+60)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 31, Dex 6, Con 20, Int 4, Wis 12, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "spit +8 (12d6 acid)", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "15 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5063, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "DodgeB, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "15", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "25, touch 7, flat-footed 24", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Dimensional Slug", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +14, Perception +10, Stealth +1", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "10", "XP": 9600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "malleable", "Saves": "Fort +15, Ref +6, Will +7", "Melee": "tongue +20 (2d10+10 plus 2d8 acid)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Huge"}
