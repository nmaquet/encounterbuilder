It cannot enter water or other liquid.

The target must make a DC 15 Will save or take 3d6 points of damage and become sickened for 1d4+1 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Vulnerability to Wind (Ex)</b> A demonic mist is treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Some scholars and sages believe a demonic mist is the incomplete manifestation of a demon on the Material Plane. Others conjecture it is a representation of chaos unleashed by the denizens of the Abyss. Whatever the true nature of its origin, a demonic mist is a creature wholly chaotic and evil. When encountered on the Material Plane it is most often in areas of consecrated ground such as graveyards, temples, and holy sites. In their native environment, demonic mists are found haunting the most putrid and disgusting of the Abyssal planes. Those planes covered with oozes, mires, fens, and swamps are favored by these creatures. Demonic mists have voracious appetites and always seem to be on the hunt. They are carnivorous creatures devouring just about anything they came across. Once a demonic mist slays its prey, it moves over the body and rapidly digests it, draining blood and body fluids, and leaving nothing more than a dried husk. A demonic mist's semi-solid body is composed of a strange, sickly green and ever-shifting mist. It can change its color to a semi-translucent whitish smoke, thereby blending in and hiding in areas of normal fog and mist. When hiding in this way, a demonic mist seeks to quickly close ground with its target and attack from ambush, unleashing its psychic crush and enervating attacks at the closest and strongest opponents. Demonic mists are often found in the employ of clerics dedicated to the demonic lords (particularly Tsathogga and Jubilex), serving as temple guards or assassins.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "0", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-6)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str -, Dex 21, Con 18, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4779, "SubType": "(chaotic, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Improved Initiative, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "8", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in fog or mist", "AC": "16, touch 16, flat-footed 10", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Demonic Mist", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +13, Escape Artist +13, Fly +21, Knowledge (planes) +8, Perception +9, Stealth +13 (+21 in fog or mist)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "2", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "gaseous", "Saves": "Fort +8, Ref +9, Will +2", "Melee": "touch +10 (5d6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "fly 50 ft.
