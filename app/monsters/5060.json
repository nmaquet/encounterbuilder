It takes no other actions during this time but can defend itself normally. It consumes an amount of flesh equal to 3 points of Constitution damage (or drain) each round. </h5><h5><b>Necrotic Touch (Su)</b> The touch of a skin feaster deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage if the target fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. If the save fails by 5 or more, 1 point is actually Constitution drain instead. The save DC is Charisma-based. </h5><h5><b>Skin Regrowth (Su)</b> If a skin feaster manages to consume an amount of flesh equal to 6 points of Constitution damage in any 24-hour period, it begins to regrow its skin. The process requires 1d6 hours and for the next 1d3 days thereafter, the skin feaster appears just as it did before its death. During this time, the skin feaster loses its flesh consumption weakness and appears human (though it is still undead). Once this period ends, the skin feaster's skin sloughs off, restoring it to its original appearance.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>When a humanoid dies as a result of being skinned alive, it often returns to the land of the living as a skin feaster; an undead creature driven by an insatiable hunger for the skin and flesh of living creatures. Only by consuming living flesh can a skin feaster relieve itself of the burning pain of its raw muscles and nerves. Skin feasters often make their lairs near populated areas where meals are plentiful. The lair itself is usually a nearby cave complex or ruined and abandoned buildings; places that allow the skin feaster to remain hidden, yet keep it close enough to feed when hungry. Skin feaster raids into towns and villages almost always occur at night. While they occasionally consume the flesh of cattle and other small game, they prefer the flesh of humanoids above all others; it's also the only way a skin feaster can regrow its flesh. During times when a skin feaster has regrown its skin, it moves around villages and towns, mingling among living creatures, planning its next meal. Skin feasters stand about 6 feet tall and generally weigh 150-180 pounds. A skin feaster slashes at its opponents with its razor-sharp fingernails, flaying off chunks of flesh with each strike. Skin feasters are so overcome with agony that they often stop in the middle of combat to devour any flesh they manage to tear away from their victims.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-7)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 16, Con -, Int 6, Wis 15, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5060, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (claw)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Skin Feaster", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +5, Climb +6, Perception +7, Stealth +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "skin regrowth", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +4, Will +6", "Melee": "2 claws +7 (1d6+1 plus necrotic touch)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
