The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The phlogiston bush (known as a fire shrub by some sages) is an immobile plant found only in temperate regions. Phlogiston bushes gain nourishment from the body fluids and organs of living creatures, particularly the bones and muscle tissue of such creatures. Being plants, they do gain sustenance from sunlight and the soil, so they can go long periods of time (reportedly up to two weeks or so) without eating, but given the chance, a phlogiston flower catches and kills any living creature that wanders too close to it. These plants generate a pleasing odor noticeable to a range of about 30 feet. It uses this odor to lure semiintelligent creatures (such as ordinary animals) into range where it can use its tendrils and fire bolt attack.</p><p>These plants rely on living creatures to spread, so on occasion, when not looking for a meal, a phlogiston flower releases a small blast of seedlings in a 5-foot cone directly in front of it. A creature in the area that fails a DC 20 Wisdom check fails to observe that tiny seeds of silvery-green hue are clinging to its body. After 1d4 hours, the seedlings drop off and take root in the immediate area, blooming into a new phlogiston flower in just under 2 months.</p><p>A phlogiston bush lies dormant until unsuspecting prey comes with range. It then slashes with its tendrils or releases a single fire bolt at its opponent. In combat, the phlogiston flower attempts to grab its prey with a tendril. Grabbed prey is held until it escapes, dies, or the plant is killed. Creatures slain by a phlogiston flower are entwined in its tendrils and slowly digested over the next 6 to 8 hours until there is nothing left (digestive acids secreted from the plant break down the bones of the victim). Being mindless, a phlogiston flower fights until either it or its prey is slain.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "-", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d8+8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 13, Con 14, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 2", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.
