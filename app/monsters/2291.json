Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit point total (minus damage dealt by magical attacks and weapons), it stands up, ready to fight again. If the creature is destroyed by channeled positive energy, it cannot reanimate. If a cleric casts <i>gentle repose</i> on the cadaver when it is reduced to 0 hit points, it cannot reanimate. A <i>bless</i> spell delays the reanimation, causing the creature to regain hit points at half the normal rate (i.e. 1 hit point every other round).</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Cadavers are the undead skeletal remains of people who have been buried alive or given an improper burial (an unmarked grave or mass grave for example). They can be found haunting graveyards and cemeteries.</p><p>Cadavers are infused with a hatred that rivals many other undead creatures. This hatred includes its own existence as well as the existence of all living creatures. Thus, the cadaver attacks all creatures it encounters.</p><p>They have a distinct hatred for light, but it does not damage them. All encounters with cadavers are at night or places cloaked in darkness.</p><p>Encounters are most often with a solitary creature. Multiple cadavers do not work in concert with each other; being mindless they simply charge into combat, killing all creatures they can. Cadavers are sometimes found in the employ of greater undead (such as wights or ghasts).</p><p>A cadaver attacks by raking with its filthy claws or biting with its sharp, disease-infested teeth. They often lie in shallow graves waiting for potential victims to wander too close, where they immediately spring to the attack, raking and biting until destroyed or until all foes are dead.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-5)", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d8)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 13, Dex 13, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 10", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "undead", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2291, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved InitiativeB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "0", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "13, touch 11, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Cadaver", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +3", "Melee": "2 claws +2 (1d4+1 plus disease) and bite +2 (1d6+1 plus disease)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
