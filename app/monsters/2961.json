A creature within the area must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the tormenting howl of that raggoth for 24 hours. Multiple uses of tormenting howl do not stack but do increase the duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Raggoths are aggressive predators with voracious appetites and a killing instinct that makes them quite deadly in battle. Though its hunting area typically covers only about a mile around its lair, raggoths are known to track their prey up to 10 or more miles. Whether this only occurs when food is scarce or if the raggoth simply hunts and tracks its prey for the sheer thrill of the hunt is unknown.</p><p>Raggoths by their very nature are solitary, though sometimes they will work together to track down an elusive target or work together to bring down a particularly powerful opponent. Typically raggoths working in concert with one another are a mated pair.</p><p>Raggoth dwell in thick forests and make their home amidst the foliage or in shallow caves and caverns. If a mated pair is encountered, there is a chance (40%) that 1d4 young are present. Young are born live and are fully dependent on their mother for the first year of their life. Around 12 to 18 months they begin to gain their independence, but do not fully leave the lair until they are around 2 years of age. A young raggoth reaches maturity around 4 years of age.</p><p>A raggoth is about 8 feet long and weighs about 450 pounds. Its fur is jet black, its nails and teeth are dull white, and its eyes are dull yellow.</p><p>Raggoths are ambush hunters and always use stealth tactics when hunting and tracking their prey. When spotted, a raggoth moves slowly toward its target and then quickly bursts from its hiding spot at its opponent. If the raggoth doesn't fell its opponent in the first round, it lets loose its tormenting howl to weaken its prey before attempting to finish it off with its terrible claws and bite. A raggoth fights to the death only if cornered or defending its lair.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or pair", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(11d10+55)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 23, Dex 16, Con 21, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 14", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2961, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Perception, Stealth, Survival)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "12", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth, +4 Survival (+8 Survival when tracking by scent)", "AC": "22, touch 12, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Raggoth", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +13, Stealth +14, Survival +8 (+16 when tracking by scent)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "6", "Race": "", "CR": "9", "XP": 6400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +12, Ref +10, Will +6", "Melee": "bite +16 (1d8+6), 4 claws +16 (1d6+6 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Large"}
