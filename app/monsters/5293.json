If the hood's attack succeeds, it can immediately attempt a grapple check against the target, and if successful, the executioner's hood can constrict. </h5><h5><b>Strangle (Ex)</b> A grappling executioner's hood entirely covers its opponent's head with an airtight grip. A creature that is grappled by the hood cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see Suffocation, <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 445), unless it doesn't speak or breathe through its head. Any attacks against the hood deal half damage to the hood and the other half to the creature that it's strangling. </h5><h5><b>Susceptible to Alcohol (Ex)</b> Strong alcohol harms the hood. Every quart poured on it deals 1 point of damage. Four quarts of alcohol incapacitates it and forces it to release a grappled target.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>These young rays are shaped roughly like hoods (hence their name), and drag themselves awkwardly about with their thin tentacles. Once an executioner's hood finds a suitable hunting ground, usually a cavern or dungeon room, it hauls itself up to a high perch and hangs there, disguising itself as an irregular stone formation or a strange bit of masonry on a dungeon wall. When suitable prey walks beneath it, the young lurking ray drops, attempting to engulf the creature's head and suffocate it, after which the ray can slowly dissolve the meat at its leisure. Executioner's hoods are hatched from eggs laid by trappers. They stay with the mother for a month, then leave to hunt for themselves.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "1", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(2d8+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 10, Dex 12, Con 12, Int 3, Wis 13, Cha 9", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5293, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Executioner's Hood", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +8, Perception +8, Stealth +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +1, Will +4", "Melee": "slam +3 (1d4 plus grab)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., climb 5 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Tiny"}
