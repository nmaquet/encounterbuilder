If it uses its ring of fire ability, its heat aura automatically dissipates and it cannot restart it again for 1 hour. </h5><h5><b>Ring of Fire (Su)</b> Once per day as a standard action, an emberleaf can create an immobile, blazing ring of fire in a 30-foot radius around its form. This fire is similar to a <i>wall of fire</i> spell. The ring of fire is 20 feet tall, and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it. Those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures passing through the ring take 3d6 points of fire damage. The ring deals this damage when it appears, and to all creatures in the area on the emberleaf's turn each round. The ring of fire lasts a number of rounds equal to the emberleaf's Hit Dice (6 rounds for a standard emberleaf). The emberleaf cannot use this ability to invoke its fire healing.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>The emberleaf is a sentient plant found deep within darkened and desolate forests where it preys on insects and other small game animals. Often times, an emberleaf makes its lair near trails or roads that wend their way through the forests in hopes of catching a larger meal passing through. An emberleaf appears as a small flowering plant with various yellow, sweet smelling flowers. It typical grows no taller than two or three feet and when at rest resembles an ordinary plant. The creature is active during the day and rests during the nighttime hours. During warmer months, the creature is more active, while during cooler months and winter, the creature is dormant most of the time. An emberleaf can go up to one month without eating. Emberleafs do not actively hunt prey. Rather, they wait for their prey to come to them. The sweet smelling flowers and aroma given off by the flowers usually attracts insects and small game who unknowingly wander into range of the emberleaf's tendrils. Particularly tough opponents are subjected to its heat aura. If extremely hungry, an emberleaf uses its ring of fire attack to prevent its prey from escaping.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Sylvan (can't speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or patch (2-4)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(6d8+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 14, Dex 15, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4941, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Emberleaf", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +10, Perception +4, Stealth +15", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +4, Will +3", "Melee": "2 tendrils +7 (1d6+2 plus 1d6 fire)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., climb 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
