They are in fact very similar to the stone golem, but are instead constructed of mud and stone. They are often used as guardians by their creators. When the stone guardian is first constructed, the creator often crafts a magical ring that offers himself (or anyone to whom he gives the ring) protection from that stone guardian. A stone guardian is 6 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds. It resembles a stocky humanoid formed of mud and stone. Where its heart should be (were it a living creature) is a fist-sized rounded stone.</p><p>Stone guardians are fierce combatants and attack with their powerful fists.<br><b>Construction</b><br> A stone guardian's body is constructed from mud mixed with rare herbs and powders worth at least 500 gp. A large chunk of stone inserted into the chest cavity functions as its \"heart.\" The magical ring that links a stone guardian is constructed at the same time and costs 300 gp to create.</p><p>All costs and requirements for both the guardian and ring are included below.<br><b>STONE GUARDIAN</b><br> <b>CL</b> 10th; <b>Price </b>13,300 gp </h5><h5><b>Requirements </b>Craft Construct, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>see invisibility</i>, <i>shield of faith</i> (for the magical ring), <i>transmute rock to mud</i>, creator must be caster level 10th; </h5><h5><b>Skill </b>Craft (sculptures or stonemasonry) DC 13, Craft (jewelry) DC 13 for the ring; </h5><h5><b>Cost </b>7,050 gp Credit The Stone Guardian originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>L1 Secret of Bone Hill</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Lenard Lakofka.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or gang (2-4)", "Ref": "0", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d10+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 21, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "construct", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2654, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 9, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Stone Guardian Golem", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "ring link", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +0, Will +1", "Melee": "2 slams +10 (1d8+5)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
