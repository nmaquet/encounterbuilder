Any creature in this area must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results generated. This is a mind-affecting effect that does not work on animals, other gremlins, or gnolls. Any character who gains any sort of luck bonus (such as that granted by a <i>luckstone or divine</i> favor) is immune to the pugwampi unluck aura.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Mean, dog-faced, and cowardly, pugwampis are loved by no one-not even other gremlins. These gremlins take disproportionate amounts of enjoyment from the accidents and missteps of other creatures, often going to great lengths to manufacture the perfect deadfalls or stumbling blocks. They then wait nearby, both to laugh at the inevitable mishaps and to make sure their personal unluckiness is passed off on their victims.</p><p>Pugwampis live in caves or ruined buildings, occasionally venturing forth to find victims upon which to inf lict their sick senses of humor. Their \"jokes\" tend to involve spikes and excrement, or sometimes pits full of spiders or campsites that flood with swamp water.</p><p>Certainly only the pugwampis consider their jokes funny.</p><p>As all pugwampis are somewhat deaf, when not trying to be stealthy, they tend to scream and yell loudly so they can hear themselves and each other.</p><p>At some point in the distant past, pugwampis became enamored of gnolls, seeing in the beast-men a kindred form and thus aspiring to the height and deadly prowess of the savage warriors, whom they honor as gods. Gnolls, for their part, hate pugwampis even more than other creatures, mostly because of the gremlins' weakness and sickening fawning, though they sometimes keep the gremlins around just to torment them.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Gnoll, Undercommon", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, mob (3-12), or infestation (13-20 with 1-3 druids of 1st-3rd level, 1 fighter leader of 2nd-4th level, 2-8 trained stirges, and 2-5 trained baboons)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(1d6+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 3, Dex 13, Con 11, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "shortbow +3 (1d3-4/x3)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1242, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Improved Initiative, ToughnessB, Weapon FinesseB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "0", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth, -4 Perception when listening", "AC": "13, touch 13, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Pugwampi", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +2, Craft (traps) +4, Disable Device +2, Perception +6 (+2 Listening), Ride +2, Stealth +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "1/2", "XP": 200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm hills", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +0, Ref +3, Will +4", "Melee": "dagger +3 (1d2-4/19-20)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "NE", "Size": "Tiny"}
