Not normally found in large numbers within the rank-and-file of demonic armies, some lords do employ these creatures as watch patrols around their palaces or along their borders. What these creatures lack in size and strength, they make up for in ferocity and determination.</p><p>Skitterdarks roam their home planes harassing other demons and creatures not native to their Abyssal planes. They have a fondness for the flesh of mortals, particularly goblins and halflings, often capturing the latter and cooking it over a slow-burning fire using an iron spit. Some skitterdarks wear the flayed skin of goblins and halflings as trophies, weaving arm bands, bracelets, or necklaces from the dried out flesh.</p><p>Skitterdarks stand 1 foot tall and weigh about 15 pounds. Its wings are crimson, its body red, and its claws blackened and usually filthy.</p><p>Skitterdarks are aggressive demons that attack using their tiny sickles or claws and bite. They rarely touch the ground during combat, preferring to attack from the air. Against good-aligned creatures they always forego weapons so they can use their profane claws. When encountered in great numbers, skitterdarks form clusters and swarm over their opponents, raking with their claws or slashing with their tiny weapons. Some skitterdarks carry poisons extracted from various abyssal plants in order to coat their weapons.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (3-6), roving band (7-10), or swarm (11-16)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(4d10+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 8, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "0 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2454, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "19, touch 16, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Skitterdark Demon", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +10, Escape Artist +10, Fly +18, Perception +8, Stealth +18, Survival +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "clustering", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +4, Will +5", "Melee": "2 claws +9 (1d3-1), bite +9 (1d4-1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "20 ft., fly 40 ft.
