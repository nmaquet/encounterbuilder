This ability has a range of 100 feet. Creatures caught in the area take 5d6 points of cold damage and the avalanche affects a creature as if hit with a bull rush (CMB +17). A DC 17 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Freezing Wind (Su)</b> Once per day, as a standard action, an algidarch can create a freezing wind that functions as a <i>wind wall</i> spell (CL 7th) and that deals 5d6 points of cold damage (DC 17 Fortitude save for half) to creatures affected by the wind. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Algidarchs are an offshoot of giants (possibly jotuns or frost giants) and dwell in crude structures built atop hills and rocky outcroppings. Entire villages are sometimes found jutting from the side of a cliff or hill. Villages are normally ruled by a chieftain (a fighter of 6th-8th level) and some contain witch doctors or shamans (both being witches, sorcerers, or clerics of 4th-6th level). Algidarchs are a selfish, malevolent race that takes great pride in both of those facts. They frequently waylay travelers on nearby roads, stealing goods, treasure, women, and whatever else they desire at the time. Captured humanoids are kept as slaves or sold to other giant races as slaves. Algidarchs rarely eat humanoids they capture. In tough times when food is scarce they might, but the meat portion of their diet is generally deer, elk, moose, and even mastodon. Algidarch adults stand around 9 feet tall and weigh roughly 1,000 pounds. Skin color among algidarchs is always pale with a slight hint of blue. Algidarchs' hair is always worn long and though color can vary slightly, it is almost always white or some shade of white. Most males have long beards they wear braided or tied. Females are slightly smaller in stature than males, but no less effective in combat. Algidarchs can live to be 225 years old. An algidarch announces its presence by flooding the area with freezing winds and a sudden avalanche. This avalanche can take the form of their special ability or can be a true avalanche caused by several algidarchs perched atop a snow-covered hillside or mountaintop. Survivors are attacked in melee with the intent of capturing or killing them. Slain opponents are left to scavengers after their bodies are looted.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, gang (3-4), hunting band (3-4 plus 5-8 frost men, 1-2 winter wolves), or tribe (5-16 plus 50% noncombatants, 4-8 frost men, 4-6 winter wolves, plus 1 adept, cleric, or sorcerer of 3rd-5th level; 1 barbarian of 4th-6th level)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d8+28 plus 7)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 10, Con 18, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4700, "SubType": "(cold, giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Intimidating Prowess, Iron Will, Power Attack, Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth in snow", "AC": "16, touch 9, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Algidarch", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +6, Intimidate +7, Perception +7, Stealth +1 (+5 in snow), Survival +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "4", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "cold hills and moutains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +2, Will +4", "Melee": "greatsword +10 (3d6+9) or 2 slams +10 (1d6+6 plus 1d6 cold)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
