It is 30 feet long and a foot thick. The body of the thing is a wormlike mass of pulpy flesh with several gill-like apertures along its length with which it propels itself through the water. The front of the beast has a long trunk similar to that of an elephant. Its skin glistens as if coated with a sheen of oil.</i></h3><br></div><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Vorin</p><p class=\"alignright\">CR 14</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>XP </b>38,400</h5><h5>CE Huge aberration </h5><h5><b>Init </b>+8; <b>Senses </b>darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +13</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DEFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AC </b>18, touch 12, flat-footed 14 (+4 Dex, +6 natural, -2 size)</h5><h5><b>hp </b>178 (17d8+102)</h5><h5><b>Fort </b>+11, <b>Ref </b>+9, <b>Will </b>+10</h5><h5><b>DR </b>15/slashing or piercing; <b>Immune </b>acid; <b>Resist </b>fire 10</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>OFFENSE</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Spd </b>40 ft.</h5><h5><b>Melee </b>sting +20 (2d6+9 plus poison), bite +19 (2d6+9)</h5><h5><b>Ranged </b>spit +15 (poison)</h5><h5><b>Space </b>15 ft.; <b>Reach </b>10 ft.</h5><h5><b>Special Attacks </b>spit</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Str </b>28, <b>Dex </b>18, <b>Con </b>23, <b>Int </b> 2, <b>Wis </b>11, <b>Cha </b>12</h5><h5><b>Base Atk </b>+12; <b>CMB </b>+23; <b>CMD </b>37</h5><h5><b>Feats </b>Alertness, Cleave, Improved Initiative, Improved Natural Attack (sting), Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth), Stealthy, Weapon Focus (spit), Weapon Focus (sting)</h5><h5><b>Skills </b>Escape Artist +6, Perception +13, Sense Motive +2, Stealth +13 (+21 in water); <b>Racial Modifiers </b>+8 Stealth in water</h5><h5><b>SQ </b>water breathing</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>ECOLOGY</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Environment </b> any marsh</h5><h5><b>Organization </b>solitary or squad (2-5)</h5><h5><b>Treasure </b>standard</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>SPECIAL ABILITIES</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Bite or spit-injury or contact; <i>save</i> Fort DC 24; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 2 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d6 Dex and paralyzed 1d4 hours; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>. The save DC is Constitution-based. An opponent struck by a blob of vorin poison spit at them is protected from its effects for a short time by any amount of worn armor-the blob strikes the armor but not the opponent's flesh. The blob of poison seeps through armor in a number of rounds equal to the armor's armor bonus (do not apply any magical bonuses). The blob can be scraped off as a move action. Natural armor does not provide any defense as the poison seeps through the opponent's pores, nor does poison delivered by a vorin's sting have the same delayed effect. </h5><h5><b>Spit (Ex)</b> Once per round a vorin can spit a blob of sticky poison with a sickening odor at a single opponent within 50 feet (no range increment). This requires the vorin to make a successful ranged touch attack. If struck, a target is subjected to the vorin's poison. </h5><h5><b>Water Breathing (Ex)</b> Vorins can breathe underwater indefinitely.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Vorins live in dismal swamps and bogs, lurking down in the murk and the mire. The eyes of a vorin are raised above the rest of the head on slight bulges. This arrangement allows the vorin to remain mostly submerged while it watches its potential prey. A typical vorin is 30 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.</p><p>The boneless body of a vorin helps to protect it from impacts. A vorin feeds and attacks with a long proboscis. This proboscis contains the creature's tongue, with is tipped with a thorny barb that can inject a paralytic poison. A vorin can also spit its poison at prey that it can't reach physically.</p><p>A vorin relies on its poison in combat, hoping to incapacitate an opponent so it can consume the victim at its leisure. It enters combat by spitting poison at any larger opponents first. The vorin tries to remain at a distance, spitting its poison and darting back below the water to slither to another location before rising again. A vorin only enters melee if pressed or if it is unable to escape.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or squad (2-5)", "Ref": "9", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(17d8+102)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 28, Dex 18, Con 23, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "spit +15 (poison)", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3419, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Cleave, Improved Initiative, Improved Natural Attack (sting), Power Attack, Skill Focus (Stealth), Stealthy, Weapon Focus (spit), Weapon Focus (sting)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "11", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Stealth in water", "AC": "18, touch 12, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Vorin", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Escape Artist +6, Perception +13, Sense Motive +2, Stealth +13 (+21 in water)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "14", "XP": 38400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any marsh", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "water breathing", "Saves": "Fort +11, Ref +9, Will +10", "Melee": "sting +20 (2d6+9 plus poison), bite +19 (2d6+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Huge"}
