Every creature in a 30 ft. radius must succeed a DC 18 Reflex save or be hit by 1d4 daggers for 1d4+2 damage each. This attack is usually performed when the flower is mortally wounded or hopelessly outnumbered. The save DC is Dexterity-based. </h5><h5><b>Thin Stem (Ex)</b> A war flower has a thin and fragile stem. The thin stem makes it extremely vulnerable to slashing weapons. A war flower that suffers a critical hit from a slashing weapon must make a Fortitude save equal to DC 10 + the damage dealt or die as result of its stem being chopped in two.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>War flowers were among of the first of the Tree That Sees creations (see <i>The Hollow Mountain</i> from Frog God Games for more information on the Tree That Sees), a union of the gentleness and beauty of the flower with the grace and deadliness of a rapier. Although only slightly smarter than normal flowers they nevertheless can follow one-word orders, tell the difference between friends and foes and fight with unpredictable style and elegance. War flowers usually wait until an enemy comes close enough to rain a hail of daggers on him before charging with their rapiers. Since they are nearly mindless they fight until either they or their designated target are dead. The group stumbles upon a group of warflowers lying in ambush for any trespassers into the Tree That Sees' realm. There is a 20% chance for a dead adventurer along with his treasure to lie in the area.
