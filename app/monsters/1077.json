It can cough out a hideous amount of this scorching fluid as a breath weapon, but the blood also serves the demon as a defensive ability. Any creature that damages a brimorak with a slashing or piercing melee weapon is sprayed by boiling blood, and takes 1d4 points of fire damage with each successful hit with such a weapon. Creatures using reach weapons are not subject to this damage. </h5><h5><b>Burning Hooves (Su)</b> A brimorak's hooves burn with fire, leaving scorched hoofprints on wood, stone, and most every other solid surface, yet this supernatural fire does not set alight surfaces the demon treads upon. It does make it easier to track a brimorak, though-Survival checks made to track a brimorak gain a +8 circumstance bonus. Brimoraks use their <i>air walk</i> ability to throw creatures off their trail, or to leave their prints in strange places (like atop roofs) to spread fear and terror. Against a prone foe, a brimorak can make two hoof attacks rather than just one. </h5><h5><b>Flaming Weapon (Su)</b> As a free action, a brimorak can infuse a wielded melee weapon (including a two-handed weapon, but not a second weapon held in the off-hand) with its fiery nature, allowing it to inflict an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with the weapon. This fire damage stacks with any additional fire damage that the weapon might also inflict. The weapon loses this ability if it leaves the demon's grasp. </h5><h5><b>Smoke Breath (Su)</b> A brimorak's breath manifests as clouds of foul-smelling smoke when it exhales. This breath surrounds the brimorak out to a radius of 5 feet-while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision or choke foes, it is enough to sicken breathing foes who are not immune to poison. A DC 17 Fortitude save grants immunity to a particular brimorak's breath for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Although brimorak demons are generally limited to regions of the Abyss where fire and smoke hold sway, in those regions they are vast in number. Demon lords like Flauros use brimoraks as the primary infantry troops in Abyssal armies-although their command of fire makes them less effective against most fiends, they are particularly devastating against many other foes.</p><p>Brimoraks are small in stature, rarely standing over 3 feet in height, yet surprisingly strong for their size. Those who underestimate these demons often don't live to learn of their errors, for brimoraks are quick to press the advantage against larger enemies after softening them up with fire magic. A brimorak's dense musculature and bones result in unexpected weight as well-one of these creatures usually weighs nearly 200 pounds.<b></p><p>Ecology</b></p><p> Brimoraks form from the souls of arsonists and those who used fire in life to torture and kill innocent victims- especially witches, heretics, and other such \"criminals\"-via burning at the stake or on a pyre.</p><p>Although a brimorak is not damaged by fire, it still feels the pain of fire as long as it lives-the boiling of its own blood is a constant reminder of its sins from a previous life. This state of constant pain is alleviated somewhat after a brimorak uses one of its fire-based spell-like abilities or its breath weapon-while this has no game effect on the demon, the temporary relief does encourage it to use its magic and breath weapon as often as possible in combat.</p><p>Many brimoraks become masochistic creatures as a result of the constant pain. In combat they often display little to no regard for their personal safety, provoking attacks of opportunity or ignoring obvious foes for the chance to hurt a helpless foe. Yet this disregard for safety doesn't descend into truly self-destructive behavior-a brimorak with fewer than half its hit points becomes suddenly more careful about its actions. Unlike most demons, who can teleport at will, brimoraks can only use this powerful spell-like ability once per day, and they generally rely upon it to get themselves out of peril rather than to ambush foes.<b></p><p>Habitat & Society</b></p><p> On the Abyss, brimoraks usually serve more powerful demons as taskmasters, thugs, or soldiers. These brimorak demons know little more than battle, and when not fighting together against a foe they tend to fight each other in an endless conf lict for superiority.</p><p>On the Material Plane, however, brimoraks take on a much more authoritative role. While most are called via spells like <i>lesser planar ally</i> or <i>lesser planar binding</i> in order to serve mortal spellcasters as minions, now and then a brimorak escapes control and can remain on Golarion. Freed from demonic overlords and binding spellcasters, a brimorak loose on the Material Plane understands that it is viewed as a monster and reacts intelligently-it does not immediately revert to an orgy of arson and destruction, but instead retreats into hiding. Free brimoraks prefer to lurk in rundown slums in large cities, in catacombs or sewers, or in remote wilderness regions. Typically, a lone brimorak seeks out a tribe of savage humanoids like goblins, orcs, gnolls, or barbarians and establishes itself as the dominant force for the tribe by killing its leader and several of the tribe's more powerful members-whatever it takes to get the tribe's survivors to bow down before the demon.</p><p>As a result, the majority of brimoraks encountered on the Material Plane are encountered as lone creatures serving as the leaders of tribes of fecund and aggressive humanoids.</p><p>Often, and particularly in the case of tribes of superstitious humanoids, the brimorak is regarded as both a chieftain and a god, with tribal adepts actually worshiping the demon out of a mixture of fear and ignorance. Of course, the brimorak is only too pleased to perpetuate such beliefs by requiring frequent sacrifices, using its defensive abilities and spell-like abilities to perform \"miracles,\" and periodically punishing its followers for real or imagined transgressions. Eventually, the brimorak has the tribe so cowed and under his control that he can finally turn to the joys of mayhem by ordering the tribe to take up ill-advised crusades against neighboring tribes or settlements. The brimorak continues to order these attacks on nearby victims until his tribe is destroyed or high-powered opponents arrive to stop it. Brimoraks who are finally confronted by foes capable of defeating them generally don't stay around to defend their followers, but instead simply teleport to some other region, whereupon they begin the process anew by seeking a new tribe of doomed savages to rule.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic, Ignan; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Book of the Damned V2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, band (2-6), or platoon (7-16)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d10+24)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 16, Con 19, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 15", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1077, "SubType": "(chaotic, demon, evil, extraplanar, fire)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Casting, Improved Initiative, Weapon Focus (longsword)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+8 Perception", "AC": "18, touch 14, flat-footed 15", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Brimorak", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +12, Bluff +11, Knowledge (engineering) +10, Knowledge (planes) +10, Perception +18, Sense Motive +10, Stealth +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "3", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Abyss; volcanic regions)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "flaming weapon", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +8, Will +3", "Melee": "longsword +11/+6 (1d6+3/19-20 plus 1d6 fire), hoof +0 (1d3+1 plus 1d6 fire)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Small"}
