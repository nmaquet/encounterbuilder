If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the crag giant takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the crag giant is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) </h5><h5><b>Stonecunning (Ex)</b> This ability functions as the dwarf's stonecunning ability.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Crag giants are malicious and capricious giants found inhabiting mountains and hills. They are highly territorial and attack most any creatures that wander into their lands. Bestial creatures are slaughtered and served as food while humanoids, especially dwarves, orcs, and humans are enslaved and forced into manual labor serving the crag giants and their ilk. When labor is in short supply and high demand, crag giant hunting parties venture forth, raiding nearby civilized lands and capturing whatever humanoids they can. Slave trade is common between crag giants, other giant races, and drow. Crag giants stand 11 feet in height, and typical weigh around 1,100 pounds. Skin color is almost always dark brown, but some slate gray crag giants have been encountered. Hair on both males and females tends to be long and worn in ponytails. Hair color ranges from black to brown to red. Eyes are usually brown or green. Crag giants generally live to be 250 years old. Crag giants are violent creatures and wade headlong into combat, swinging their massive clubs or smashing their foes with their great fists. If interlopers are detected early and crag giants have the high ground, they bombard their foes with rocks, moving in to mop up any survivors.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Giant", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-5), band (4-8), or tribe (10-20 plus 40% noncombatants, 1-2 elders, and 4-8 gargoyles)", "Ref": "4", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(14d8+70)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 29, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 12", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rock +10 (2d8+13)", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4956, "SubType": "(giant)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Awesome Blow, Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Sunder, Intimidating Prowess, Iron Will, Martial Weapon Proficiency (greatclub)B, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "14", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "25, touch 9, flat-footed 25", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Crag Giant", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Climb +24, Intimidate +20, Perception +14, Stealth +2, Survival +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "11", "XP": 12800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "stonecunning", "Saves": "Fort +14, Ref +4, Will +7", "Melee": "greatclub +18/+13 (2d8+13) or 2 slams +18 (1d8+9)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "40 ft., climb 30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Large"}
