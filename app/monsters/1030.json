The corpse cannot leave the stump or perform complex actions, but is instead used to lure larger prey within range of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's tentacles. The largest corpse a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can manipulate in this fashion is two size categories smaller than itself (thus Tiny creatures for a Medium wolf-in-sheep's-clothing). </h5><h5><b>Implant (Ex)</b> By tricking a creature into eating a corpse lure containing a wolf-in-sheep'sclothing seed, or by forcing the seed down a creature's throat as a successful pin attack while grappling, a wolf-in-sheep'sclothing can infest a living creature with its own parasitic offspring. Unless the creature is able to make a DC 19 Fortitude save, this seed gestates and becomes a self-aware creature that slowly steals nourishment from its host before finally exploding free of its host's gut. The parasite can be cut free of the host's intestines with a DC 25 Heal check, which takes 1 hour and deals 3d6 slashing damage regardless of success or failure. <i>Wolf-in-sheep's-clothing</i> egg: ingestion; save Fort 19; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage until host reaches 0, then 3d6 damage as parasite bursts free; cure surgical removal of egg (Heal DC 25, dealing 3d6 slashing damage whether successful or not). The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Skills</b> The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's racial bonus to disguise applies only to its ability to disguise itself as a tree stump and its corpse lure as a still-living creature.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing appears at first to be little more than a tree stump sitting in a clearing, perhaps with a small animal sitting atop it. Only when a predator comes close does it become clear that the small animal is in fact long dead, given false life by tendrils springing up through its form, but by then it's too late, as the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing drags the would-be hunter into its waiting maw.</p><p>Wolves-in-sheep's-clothing lure their true prey close by killing smaller creatures and animating them. Though intelligent, they see little need for the company of others, and slaughter all who enter their domains. During reproduction, they place strange seed-eggs inside their lures and either allow unfortunate creatures to devour the rotting carcasses or force the eggs down the throats of warier victims. Either method leads to sickness as the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing egg slowly gestates, then bursts forth horrifically.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Misfit Monsters", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(13d8+39)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 10, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 7", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.
