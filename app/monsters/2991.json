In the wild, gilded sea serpents live on the most secluded islands and hidden lagoons, where they nest in sandy lairs and shallow, sun-warmed waters. Wealthy coastal lords have been known to acquire gilded sea serpent eggs or infants and raised them captivity. These serpents are usually revered as holy or prized as status symbols; captive gilded serpents that are mistreated quickly lose the will to live and die.</p><p>The golden hide of a gilded serpent can be harvested and made into a single set of scale mail that fits a Medium or smaller creature. This armor is considered masterwork, and has the same properties as mithral scale armor.</p><p>The poison of the gilded serpent can be milked or harvested as well, then made into a powerful narcotic drug called golden bliss (see sidebar).</p><p>Gilded sea serpents flee danger when they can, using their ability to swim swiftly to evade danger as quickly as possible. If cornered or surprised, however, they lash out with their bite, and use their constriction attack if their prey is small enough. The venom of a gilded sea serpent numbs the flesh to pain and induces a state of catatonic stupor.<br><b>Golden Bliss</b><br> This drug is made from the venom of a gilded sea serpent.</p><p>A serpent that is milked of its venom produces enough poison to make 2d4 doses of golden bliss per day. This requires a DC 15 Craft (alchemy or poison) check. When inhaled, the drug produces a euphoric catatonia and provides complete protection against mind-influencing magic and psionic incursion.<br><b>GOLDEN BLISS</b><br> Type: inhaled; </h5><h5><b>Addiction </b>severe, Fortitude DC 15 </h5><h5><b>Price </b>40 gp </h5><h5><b>Effects </b>1d3x10 minutes; +4 Charisma, immunity to mind-affecting effects and psionic incursion.</p><p></h5><h5><b>Damage </b>4 Wisdom damage Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Patrick Lawinger.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair or cluster (3-8)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(5d12+20)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 19, Con 16, Int 7, Wis 16, Cha 17", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2991, "SubType": "(aquatic)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Great Fortitude, Swim-By AttackB, Toughness, Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "9", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "30, touch 14, flat-footed 26", "Swim": "1", "Name": "Gilded Sea Serpent", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +11, Stealth +12, Survival +11, Swim +17", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate and warm aquatic", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +9, Ref +8, Will +7", "Melee": "bite +9 (1d8+1 plus poison)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "10 ft., swim 40 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Medium"}
