They're bloodthirsty and are very easy to anger. They will jump into fights they have no stake in just to snap bones and draw blood. Weresharks prefer life at sea or in port settlements commonly frequented by seagoing merchants and pirates. They can be found leading pirate gangs or loitering at seaside taverns accompanied by crowds of toadies. Since they get into fights so often, they try to stick close to the sea so they can escape into the water if they bite off more than they can chew. The other members of a wereshark's crew learn quickly that the boss is bound to skip out without much notice once a bigger fish comes along.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or shiver (3-6)", "Ref": "2", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d10+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 17, Dex 12, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 15, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "humanoid", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 5300, "SubType": "(human, shapechanger)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Cleave, Great Cleave, Power Attack, Toughness, Weapon Focus (trident)", "AlternateNameForm": "Human Form", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "fighter 3", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "11, touch 11, flat-footed 10", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Wereshark", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Survival +8, Swim +10", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "+3 (+1 vs. fear)", "Race": "Human natural wereshark", "CR": "3", "XP": 800, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any oceans or coastlines", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "armor training 1, change shape (human, hybrid, and shark; polymorph), lycanthropic empathy (sharks and dire sharks)", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +3 (+1 vs. fear)", "Melee": "mwk trident +9 (1d8+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CE", "Size": "Medium"}
