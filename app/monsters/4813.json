It is immune to any effect that requires the target be able to hear. </h5><h5><b>Stench Aura (Ex)</b> An edon's stench aura affects only humans and halflings, and creatures with the scent special ability. All other creatures are immune to its effects. An edon can suppress its stench for 1d2 hours by rubbing juniper berries on its body. Doing so negates the aura for the duration.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Edons are forest-dwelling creatures with a great fondness for human and halfling flesh. At first glance they appear to be monkeys or small apes with powerful arms and sharp claws. They are territorial creatures that dine on mosses, leaves, small forest animals, and of course their favorite meal: humans and halflings. Edons are active during the day and rest in their treetop lairs at night. An edon stands about 3 feet tall and weighs around 60 pounds. Its fur is brown or brownish-gray and its eyes are gray. An edon has a lifespan of roughly 50 years. Edons are completely deaf and do not speak, though they do seem to understand the Sylvan tongue. They communicate with others of their kind through body motion and sign language. Edons attack by hiding among the treetops and dropping on unsuspecting prey. They are relentless in their attacks, slashing and biting their foe until it is dead. Edons realize they are not the strongest or largest creatures, so they rely on their sheer numbers to gang up on their foes. Recent encounters with packs of edons have led to stories of pack leaders who appear to be smarter than the average edon and who employ traps such as tripwires and deadfalls to catch or disable their prey.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Sylvan (can't speak)", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "gang (2-5) or pack (6-11)", "Ref": "5", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(2d10+4)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 12, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 4, Wis 12, Cha 8", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "magical beast", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4813, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "5", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Acrobatics, +4 Climb", "AC": "14, touch 13, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Edon", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +10, Climb +13, Perception +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "warm or temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "deaf", "Saves": "Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +1", "Melee": "2 claws +5 (1d3+1), bite +5 (1d4+1)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 20 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
