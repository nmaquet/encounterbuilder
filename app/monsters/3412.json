Vegepygmies are low-intelligence plants that make their home deep in the forests or underground away from most settled areas. They are hunters and scavengers, and carnivorous, preying on living creatures weaker than themselves.</p><p>A vegepygmy ranges from two feet to four and a half feet tall. Though they do not seem to have ears, it is well known that vegepygmies can hear.</p><p>Vegepygmies do not speak, but communicate with others of their kind by thumping their chest or rapping their spears on rocks, earth, or some other solid surface. It is not known if or how they communicate with other creatures.</p><p>Vegepygmies attack with claws or weapons, usually either a longspear or club. They prefer to ambush opponents, using their coloration to blend with their natural surroundings.</p><p>Credit The Vegepygmy originally appeared in the First Edition module <i>S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1980) and later in the First Edition <i>Monster Manual II</i> (\u00a9 TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original material by Gary Gygax.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "(Commoner and Worker) gang (2-5) or work force (4-7)", "Ref": "3", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(3d8+3)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 11, Dex 14, Con 11, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 10", "Gear": "spear", "Ranged": "spear +5 (1d6/x3)", "Type": "plant", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 3412, "SubType": "(fungus)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Skill Focus (Perception), Toughness", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "3", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "+4 Stealth (+12 in forested or swampy areas)", "AC": "16, touch 13, flat-footed 14", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Vegepygmy Worker", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Perception +9, Stealth +10 (+18 in forested or swampy areas)", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "1", "Race": "", "CR": "1", "XP": 400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any underground", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +1", "Melee": "2 claws +3 (1d3) or spear +3 (1d6/x3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "N", "Size": "Small"}
