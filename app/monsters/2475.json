Before her coming, lilins were unknown in the Hells. Rumors spoken in hushed whispers say lilins are the offspring of Lilith and an incubus (male demon akin to the succubus). For this, lilins are often viewed with contempt and hatred among devilkind.</p><p>Among the devilish ranks, lilins serve as spies and information gatherers.</p><p>Though they possess decent combat skills, they generally do not serve in the hellish armies in any other role. Many an arch-devil, ignoring the foolish rumors that lilins are indeed some demon-devil crossbreed, has employed the services of a lilin on more than one occasion. Even now, many arch-devils keep a small retinue of these devilish mistresses stashed in a rival's palace gathering as much information as they can on each other.</p><p>A lilin appears as a crimson-skinned woman about 5-1/2 feet tall with long dark hair. Her eyes are deep black with flecks of blue. Her wings are black and leathery and her arms end in clawed hands. Lilins dress in light colored flowing gowns and robes and carry their longswords slung at their hips.</p><p>A lilin always enters combat with her <i>protection from good</i> in effect and begins by attempting to charm the closest foe. A weak-minded foe that comes within range is subjected to a <i>suggestion</i>. Afterwards she usually attacks with her longsword. If combat goes poorly for a lilin she attempts to flee but not before summoning a host of devils to cover her escape.</p><p>Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Abyssal, Common, Infernal; telepathy 100 ft.", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or harem (6-9)", "Ref": "10", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(7d10+35)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 16, Con 20, Int 15, Wis 16, Cha 26", "Gear": "+1 longsword", "Ranged": "", "Type": "outsider", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2475, "SubType": "(devil, evil, extraplanar, lawful)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Alertness, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Persuasive", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "7", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 13, flat-footed 17", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Lilin Devil", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Bluff +18, Diplomacy +19, Fly +7, Heal +13, Intimidate +20, Knowledge (planes) +12, Perception +15, Sense Motive +15, Survival +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "10", "Race": "", "CR": "6", "XP": 2400, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "any (Hell or Infernus)", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +7, Ref +10, Will +10", "Melee": "+1 longsword +11/+6 (1d8+4/19-20) or 2 claws +10 (1d6+3)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 50 ft.
