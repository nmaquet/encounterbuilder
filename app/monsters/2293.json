Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become confused for 2d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same carrion moth's drone attack for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Stench (Ex)</b> When a carrion moth dies, its carcass splits open and releases a foul-smelling gas. All living creatures (except other carrion moths) within 5 feet of the carcass must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. A <i>delay poison</i> or <i>neutralize poison</i> spell removes the effect from the nauseated creature. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>The carrion moth is believed by sages to be an advanced form of a slime crawler. Just as the caterpillar grows into a moth, sages believe the mature slime crawler eventually sheds its form and transforms into the carrion moth. No cocoon or evidence has been found to support this theory, but it is widely accepted among the more learned sages of the world.</p><p>The carrion moth is a large moth-like creature growing to a maximum length of 20 feet. Its wings are lined with tiny holes and veins that allow the carrion moth to emit a whining drone that affects all creatures that hear it. Carrion moths are attracted to the stench of decaying flesh and the light of anything larger than a torch or lantern.</p><p>A carrion moth attacks by biting with its mandibles and slapping with its tentacles. Paralyzed creatures are carried off and devoured.</p><p>Copyright Notice Authors Casey Christofferson and Scott Greene.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "", "Source": "Tome of Horrors Complete", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary or swarm (2-12)", "Ref": "6", "Climb": "1", "HD": "(7d8+14)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 16, Dex 18, Con 14, Int 1, Wis 16, Cha 6", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "aberration", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 2293, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Combat Reflexes, Skill Focus (Perception), Weapon Finesse", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 13, flat-footed 16", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Carrion Moth", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Climb +11, Fly +4, Perception +12, Stealth +5", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "8", "Race": "", "CR": "5", "XP": 1600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "stench", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +6, Will +8", "Melee": "bite +8 bite (2d8+3), 4 tentacles +3 (paralysis)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., climb 15 ft., fly 60 ft.
