This attack has a range of 100 feet and deals 7d6 points of electricity damage (DC 18 Reflex half) to all creatures within a 20-foot radius spread. Once a storm drake has used its lightning breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. </h5><h5><b>Savage Bite (Ex)</b> A storm drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. </h5><h5><b>Speed Surge (Ex)</b> Three times per day as a swift action, a storm drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round. </h5><h5><b>Storm Vision (Ex)</b> A storm drake can see through fog, clouds, and similar obscuring effects with perfect clarity, including areas affected by spells such as <i>obscuring mist</i> and <i>fog cloud</i>.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Storm drakes are fierce creatures that make their lairs high atop storm-ravaged mountains. From here, they can survey their territory, and dive to the attack when a potential meal is spotted. Favored meals include humanoids of all kinds, and large game such as deer, elk, and moose. Storm drakes are generally 20 feet long from nose to tail and weigh over 3,000 pounds. Colors range from dark, dull gray to slate gray mottled with lighter grays. Claws and talons are black and its eyes are the color of dark storm clouds. Storm drakes typically live 300 years. A storm drake is merciless in combat, biting and slashing its foes with its dagger-like teeth and claws. An ambush hunter by nature, a storm drake's approach is usually foreshadowed by a sudden shift in the weather from clear or slightly overcast skies to dark skies and storms.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Draconic", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or wing (3-8)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(8d12+32)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 22, Dex 13, Con 18, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "", "Type": "dragon", "Reach": "10 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4805, "SubType": "(air)", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "10", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "20, touch 10, flat-footed 19", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Storm Drake", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Fly +10, Intimidate +12, Knowledge (nature) +6, Perception +12, Stealth +8, Survival +8", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "9", "Race": "", "CR": "7", "XP": 3200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate mountains", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "speed surge", "Saves": "Fort +10, Ref +7, Will +9", "Melee": "bite +13 (2d6+6/19-20), 2 claws +13 (1d6+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.
