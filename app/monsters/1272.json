As a free action, a korred can cause its long hair to reach out and interfere with adjacent creatures- tugging at clothes and weapons, tangling feet and arms, tickling, and generally making a nuisance of itself. The korred can select which adjacent targets are affected by its animated hair. These targets must make a successful DC 16 Reflex save each round to avoid becoming entangled for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based. </h5><h5><b>Stone Stride (Su)</b> This ability works like <i>tree stride</i>, except it requires loose boulders at least as large as the korred, and only has a range of 30 feet. The korred can use this ability once per round as a standard action. </h5><h5><b>Stunning Laugh (Su)</b> Three times per day as a standard action, a korred can unleash a strange laugh that stuns all creatures within a 30-foot burst for 1d2 rounds (Fortitude DC 14 negates). This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Fey are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br></br><div><h4><p><p>Korreds are an ancient fey race who like forested areas with nice, rocky ground. They resemble small, wildhaired humanoids with wild, knotted hair. Korreds especially like to dance in ancient stone circles within forest glades, often led by satyrs with panpipes. They are a shy race and do not take kindly to outsiders discovering them, even by accident. They almost always attack nonkorreds who stumble into their territory, seeking to kill them or at least drive them off.</p><p>Korred clothing normally consists of a simple leather apron, jerkin, or kilt, leaving their legs uncovered and their feet bare. Their clothes usually have a large pocket or pouch to hold their belongings. A korred's hair and beard grow quickly, sometimes an inch a day, and the korred trims its hair when the locks become too unruly, saving the trimmings in its pocket so it can weave them into ropes for its <i>animate rope</i> spell-like ability.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "PFRPG Bestiary 2", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, pair, or gang (3-6)", "Ref": "8", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(6d6+12)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 19, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 13", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "rock +8 (1d6+4)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 1272, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Mobility, Skill Focus (Perception)", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "4", "Fly": "0", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 15, flat-footed 13", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Korred", "VariantParent": "", "Skills": "Acrobatics +12, Bluff +10, Craft (rope) +10, Craft (sculpture) +10, Perception +14, Perform (dance) +10, Stealth +16", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "7", "Race": "", "CR": "4", "XP": 1200, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "stone stride", "Saves": "Fort +4, Ref +8, Will +7", "Melee": "club +8 (1d4+6)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft.", "Alignment": "CN", "Size": "Small"}
