A DC 14 Will save negates the effect. On a failed save, the target is permanently cursed. The victim of the curse takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and checks until the curse is removed. A creature can only be affected by a single jynx at one time. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</h5></div><br><div><h4><p><p>Jynx are small whimsical, fun-loving forest fey thought to be an offshoot of the elven race. They live in small moss-covered caves within their forests, with such caves often being located near well-travelled roads and paths, but still well hidden from prying eyes. This location makes it much easier for the jynx to partake in one of their favorite pastimes-leading travelers astray. Jynx rarely try to harm the target of their pranks; they simply delight in sewing confusion and watching the target's reactions to such events. Those that despoil the forests on the other hand, are led astray and often led into jynx-placed traps that seek to maim or even kill such creatures. Jynx have good relations with other forest-dwelling humanoids and creatures (elves, sprites, pixies, etc.) and can often be found in their midst. They are on good terms with neutral and good-aligned druids and rangers as well. A typical jynx stands around 3 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds. Skin color is usually tan and hair color varies wildly from the deepest blacks to the brightest blondes. Eyes are most often deep blue or dark green. A jynx's lifespan is about 300 years. Jynx tend to avoid melee combat, preferring to assault their enemies with their spell-like abilities and shortbows.</p></h4></div>", "Languages": "Common, Sylvan", "Source": "Tome of Horrors 4", "Land": "1", "Organization": "solitary, gang (2-4), or band (6-11)", "Ref": "7", "Climb": "0", "HD": "(2d6+2)", "AbilitiyScores": "Str 7, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 16", "Gear": "", "Ranged": "shortbow +6 (1d4-2)", "Type": "fey", "Reach": "5 ft.", "DontUseRacialHD": "0", "id": 4982, "SubType": "", "MonsterSource": "", "Feats": "Dodge, Weapon FinesseB", "AlternateNameForm": "", "CompanionFlag": "0", "MT": "0", "Class": "", "Fort": "1", "Fly": "1", "RacialMods": "", "AC": "17, touch 16, flat-footed 12", "Swim": "0", "Name": "Jynx", "VariantParent": "NULL", "Skills": "Acrobatics +9, Bluff +8, Escape Artist +9, Fly +19, Knowledge (nature) +7, Perception +7, Sense Motive +7, Stealth +13", "ClassArchetypes": "", "IsTemplate": "0", "Will": "5", "Race": "", "CR": "2", "XP": 600, "TemplatesApplied": "", "Environment": "temperate forests", "CharacterFlag": "0", "OtherGear": "", "UniqueMonster": "0", "SQ": "", "Saves": "Fort +1, Ref +7, Will +5", "Melee": "short sword +6 (1d4-2)", "Burrow": "0", "CompanionFamiliarLink": "NULL", "AgeCategory": "NULL", "MR": 0, "Speed": "30 ft., fly 80 ft.
