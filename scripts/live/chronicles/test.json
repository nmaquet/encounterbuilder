They once ruled the world with vast empires, and today view most other forms of life as either food or slaves-and sometimes both. They disdain the gods and see themselves as the true masters of creation.</p><p>An aboleth is 25 feet long and weighs 6,500 pounds.</p><p>In the darkest reaches of the sea, aboleths still dwell in grotesque cities built in nauseating and cyclopean styles.</p><p>There they are served by countless slaves culled from every nation, air-breathing and aquatic alike, although the air-breathing slaves are doubly bound by magic and the need to constantly replenish their water-breathing ability via the excretions of their aboleth masters.

Any non-achaierai within 10 feet of the achaierai immediately takes 2d6 points of damage as its tissues burn and melt and rot away. The cloud erodes sanity as well as flesh, and anyone who takes damage from the black cloud must also make a DC 15 Fortitude save or become confused. Every round, the victim may attempt another DC 15 Fortitude save to recover from the confusion; otherwise it persists, lasting indefinitely until the condition is removed or the victim eventually makes his saving throw. The confusion element of a black cloud is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
