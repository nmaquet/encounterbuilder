Men built these cities with narrow entrances and passageways, so that they could be easily defended. The largest of these cities could easily hold several thousand people and were an intricate set of hundreds of connected rooms. In addition to bedrooms and dining rooms, the underground cities also had rooms for trading, the storage of food, smithing, and even temples and graveyards. Large vertical shafts provided a connection to the outside air, and served both as a ventilation system and as a series of connected wells that accessed a nearby underground lake. The underground cities had often several entrances and some were connected to each other by a network of tunnels.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The fate of Kuyunedir -one of the oldest and largest underground city ever built by men- is a dark one. Built 3,500 years ago, it withstood the assault of hundreds of armies coming from the surface of the world. Confident in the protective powers of their city, the people of Kuyunedir prospered for a long time and their city expanded downward as their population grew in numbers -over 20,000 souls at their peak. The history of Kuyunedir took a sudden dark turn when the digging of a new nursery opened a passage to the Underworld -the dark and hidden underground realm that is home to Drows, Derros and other unspeakable vermin. For several years, Kuyunedir fought bravely and tried to defend itself from the simultaneous attacks from the surface and the Underworld, but it soon proved too much. To save itself, the leaders of the city pleaded the local Drow king for peace, who accepted in exchange for Kuyunedir&rsquo;s most precious resource: their children. Half of the city&rsquo;s offspring were thus offered as slaves to the Drows, a situation that went on for centuries. Little by little the inhabitants of Kuyunedir began to worship demon lords, emulating their Drow masters.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In the end, the doom of Kuyunedir wasn&rsquo;t caused by Drows or Giants or Goblins, but by a terrible earthquake. Approximately 1,000 years ago, the mountain of Hollow Peak -under which Kuyunedir was built- shook so violently that it plunged the city several hundred feet down into the mountain&rsquo;s belly. The survivors of the catastrophe were never able (or unwilling) to escape to the surface and the people of Kuyunedir slowly degenerated. Generation by generation they became less and less human, eventually losing their sense of sight and having their skin turned completely white. After a millenia of progressive transformation, the people of Kuyunedir lost their humanity completely and became savage underground creatures known as Morlocks.</span></p>"

It used to be a prosperous mining town, selling nuggets of gold, silver and gemstones on the markets of the nearby city located at the bottom of the valley. As year progressed, the mine -called the Howling Well by the villagers of Horntop as it often emits a howling sound in windy weather and it&rsquo;s mostly dug out vertically- expanded progressively downward into the depths of Hollow Peak. By digging too deep, the miners of Horntop would soon repeat Kuyundir&rsquo;s fatal mistake. About a century ago, the miners of Horntop pierced the outer wall of Kuyunedir and were promptly massacred by a savage swarm of Morlocks. In the end, the villagers managed to fight off the Morlocks and seal the breach with a huge round stone. The mayor of the time -a sturdy war veteran called Derek Wickle- arranged for the Sealing Stone to be inscribed with a protective rune to prevent anyone from disturbing it. &nbsp;In addition, he declared the mine off limits and forbade anyone from ever entering it. &nbsp;The responsibility of safeguarding the Sealing Stone and preventing anyone from entering the Howling Well was transmitted from mayor to mayor ever since. The loss of the mine was a tough blow to Horntop&rsquo;s economy, and many left town to find better conditions in the valley. Today, a hundred years after the dramatic events at the Howling Well, the situation has normalized and the village is reasonably prosperous, living off the produce of their cattle -mainly yaks, and mountain goats.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The current Mayor of Horntop is an old white-bearded and hunch backed yak farmer called Larrell Flynn. Like previous mayors of Horntop, he has inherited the responsibility of keeping people out of the mines. Every season, he descends down the mine to check that the rune is still in place, as it is sometimes triggered by wandering creatures. When the Rune of Warding needs to be recast, Larell hires the services of an old friend of his from the nearby city, an eccentric Elf wizard named Jacod Farkas. Unbeknownst to the Mayor, Jacod Farkas is in fact a Dark Elf who was forever banished long ago by his kin. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

Ever since his banishment, Jacod has longed to break free from his exile and return to his homeland, so Farkas never gave too much attention to what lay beneath the Sealing Stone that he was hired to protect, but quickly realized that what he was looking for was right under his nose all these years. Cursing his stupidity, the Elf proceeded to explore the ancient city of Kuyunedir, while taking great care to hide his intentions from Mayor Flynn and the villagers.</span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Well prepared, Farkas had little trouble to enslave the Morlocks as they proved no match for his powerful magic. Jarkas also found a number of other creatures -mostly vermin- living in the ancient city and he proceeded to incinerate those that were of no use to him. There were two notable exceptions, however. First, Farkas managed to capture a young white dragon named Rompuk who foolishly believed this weird-looking lonely human would be a nice change to his usual Morlock-based diet. Second, a couple of Ice Trolls and their offspring, who had claimed the lower levels of Kuyunedir as their hunting grounds, were particularly hard for the Wizard to dispatch. The male Troll -an unusually cunning and treacherous beast named Krakoth- eventually cowardly escaped with his only surviving sibling. Since then, Krakoth has had no choice but to prey on the cattle surrounding Horntop to feed himself and his son.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Finally, two days ago, a group of daredevil teenagers from the village entered the mines and dared each other to explore the deepest levels. Most of them did not go far but, tragically, the eldest managed to reach the Sealing Stone and perished in the Rune&rsquo;s explosion. When his friends saw that he didn&rsquo;t come back hours later, they panicked and returned to the village, &nbsp;explaining what happened. Some villagers wanted to send a rescue team but the Mayor forbade it, sending Farkas instead. The Elf wizard proceeded to retrieve the boy&rsquo;s body from the Howling Well to the village, taking the opportunity to replace the Rune and raising the surrounding miner skeletons to scare any other villager away.</span></p>"

On the way, they deal with the natural dangers of climbing the steep icy slopes that lead to the village. Upon their arrival in Horntop, the PCs are surprised to find the whole town gathered for the funeral of a teenage boy who died while exploring the Howling Well. The PCs are welcomed to attend the funeral and spend some time speaking to the villagers, Mayor Flynn, and Jarod Farkas. After the funeral, the boy&rsquo;s mother implores the PCs to investigate the mine and uncover the truth behind her son&rsquo;s passing. The PCs are then invited by the mayor to stay at the local inn, and to watch for the arriving Troll at dawn on the next morning. The PCs have the opportunity to ask questions to the villagers regarding the Troll attacks as a way to learn more about the creature. The next day, the PCs surprise the Troll preying on a herd of yaks, and they can attempt to track it to its lair. The Troll will attempt to fight if attacked in his lair, but he has no interest in dying prematurely and will tell its story and that of the evil Dark Elf who drove him out of his lair. At this point, the PCs should go investigate the Howling Well. On their way to the entrance of the mine, the PCs must deal with a nasty blizzard, avalanches and treacherous icy pits. As the PCs enter the mine, they must first deal with a band of century old skeletons armed with pickaxes (the remains of the Horntop miners and the latest upgrade in security that Farkas has implemented). When they reach the bottom of the mine, the PCs find the Sealing Stone and its glowing rune and must find a way to bypass it. The PCs eventually enter the ancient underground city of Kuyunedir. The city is filled with dangers and relics of its troubled past. If the PCs survive the encounters with the various monsters that still dwell in the city, they eventually confront Jacod who has just now found was he was looking for all these years: a new entrance to the Underworld. While the PCs can attempt to reason with the Dark Elf, he has no intention of leaving the PCs alive now that they know his true nature and the existence of the entrance to the Underworld. After defeating the Drow, the PCs climb down back to the village and can choose to either reveal the truth or keep the secrets that they have learned to themselves. Whichever they choose, the denizens of the Underworld have taken notice of Jacod&rsquo;s breach, and the whole region is now at risk from attacks by the creatures of the realm below.</span></p>"

At the start of the adventure the players are supposed to be in a city not too far from Horntop. Harold Welsh, a merchant coming back from Horntop, brings news that &nbsp;the mayor of his village offers a sizable reward for the slaying of a monster who has been plaguing Horntop for the past few months. As Harold travels to Horntop regularly, the monster is starting to worry him and he seeks adventurers who are interested in (relatively) easy money. If that&rsquo;s not enough motivation Harold tries to convince them by telling them that Hollow Peak owes its name to a large and mysterious set underground caves and of the lost treasures that surely lie inside. He also tells the PCs of the abandoned mine that would earn a fortune to anyone who could lift its curse. If players ask more about the mine, Harold says he only knows that what looked like a perfectly good mine was suddenly abandoned when a terrible accident killed all the workers. Harold isn&rsquo;t being entirely truthful here, the mine is largely worthless. But the legends of Hollow Peak&rsquo;s set of underground caves are mostly true. Even if the PCs don&rsquo;t require extra motivation to travel to Horntop, the merchant can still reveal the information above if the players simply ask more information about the village.</span></p>"

A young shepherd boy named Kenneth is screaming his lungs out and runs after the beast with a large stick.

As long as the animal remains frightened, it charges down by following the path and will attempt to overrun anything it is way. Any PC who leaves the path to avoid the Yak must succeed a DC 12 Climb check or fall down and suffer 2d6 point of damage. If the PCs manage to calm the animal (using for example Charm Animal, Sleep, Daze Monster, or a DC 20 handle animal check), the boy thanks the PCs for their help. If the PCs kill the yak, the boy curses heavily at them and demands 50 gp as compensation. If the PCs simply avoid (or try to avoid) the yak, it continues it&rsquo;s charge down the mountain with the boy running after it. If the PCs study the calmed or dead Yak&rsquo;s wounds, a DC 10 heal check reveals that it has been bitten by a humanoid creature with huge teeth. A DC 20 knowledge nature or knowledge local check reveals the characteristic bite marks of an Ice Troll.</span></p>"

The village is made of about a hundred elongated stone houses with roofs made of dark blue slate. The dwelling of Horntop are arranged in rows along the flank of the mountain, and the whole village is structured as a giant staircase of successive terrasses with narrow dirt paths criss-crossing between the houses. The track that the PCs arrive from widens to a large muddy main street that runs through the center of the village. The PCs see absolutely no human soul when they arrive to Horntop but do encounter the occasional stray chicken or begging dog. After a few minutes of walking through the village, the players eventually hear the sound of voices and bells ringing coming from the opposite end of Horntop.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The PCs arrive to a gathering of about 200 villagers, all dressed in grey or white, and with somber faces. The players quickly realize that they just stumbled into the funeral of a young boy, who lies on a large and flat stone in the middle of the crowd. His body is entirely draped into a thin black shroud and is surrounded with yellow and red mountain &ldquo;flowers&rdquo; made out of dyed yak wool. A DC 20 perception check reveals that the boy has suffered severe burns and that the shroud and flowers are probably there to make this less noticeable. Next to the body, the crowd absent-mindedly listen to an old white-bearded and hunchbacked man who is currently giving a speech (the players only hear the end of it).</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&hellip; a very sad tragedy.

The Mayor proceeds to explain that the attacks have been going on for the past two months and that if the the loss of cattle continues, it would greatly damage the town&rsquo;s prosperity. He explains that the monster did not yet kill any villagers but that he&rsquo;s grown more bold of late and that someone is bound to die sooner or later. If the PCs ask for help and succeed a DC 15 diplomacy check, the mayor reluctantly offers to lend some mountain climbing supplies (treat these as masterwork tools for the Climb skill) that he insists on getting back. He otherwise apologises that he can&rsquo;t do more to help, invoking the town&rsquo;s current hardships.</span></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</h2>"

She tells them that she overheard them speaking with the mayor and thanks them for bravely accepting to hunt down the beast that has been terrorizing the village. She presents herself as the mother of the deceased child and explains that she suspects that his death was not a simple accident. If the PCs ask for more details, she collapses in tears and talks of the horrible burns that cover the boy&rsquo;s body. She tells them that she cannot bear to live without knowing what happened to her son and begs the PCs to uncover the truth. If asked for payment, she looks desperate, but grudgingly accepts to offer the PCs one of her family treasures: a masterwork pickaxe that was forged by one of her ancestors. If the players ask the mother why her son was in the mines, she explains that she has heard of kids daring each other to enter the mines and going deeper and deeper. If they wish, the players can meet the children and interrogate them. They do not hesitate to tell what happened to the PCs and one of them explains that he heard a very loud explosion coming from the bottom of the mine.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></p>"

They display the typical hunched posture of trolls, combined with long arms tipped with sharp claws and the distinctive troll underbite. Like normal trolls, ice trolls possess amazing regenerative powers that enable them to recover from almost any wound. Unlike most trolls, ice trolls often use weapons in battle, but in the heat of combat, they often cast aside weapons in favor of their rending claws. An ice troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 900 pounds. Because of their greater intellects, ice trolls sometimes work as mercenaries, and often serve as soldiers in monstrous armies. They frequently ally with frost giants, and may even be found among northern barbarian tribes, as long as they are well fed and well paid. Ice trolls enjoy the taste of human flesh, and those not working with humans frequently set traps near civilized areas to catch their favorite prey. They will also raid isolated settlements for food, often bringing captured humans back to their icy lairs, where the unfortunate victims are caged and fattened up before finally being devoured by the voracious trolls. In combat, ice trolls are more cautious than normal trolls. They do not normally rush headlong into battle, instead focusing on weaker foes or those bearing fire. They do not hesitate to attack opponents armed with fire, but work together to defeat such enemies before they can bring their dangerous weapons to bear. Ice troll society is more patriarchal than normal troll society, and while males may form gangs to hunt or raid, most ice trolls live in small family groups comprised of a male, a female, and their offspring.</p>",

They display the typical hunched posture of trolls, combined with long arms tipped with sharp claws and the distinctive troll underbite. Like normal trolls, ice trolls possess amazing regenerative powers that enable them to recover from almost any wound. Unlike most trolls, ice trolls often use weapons in battle, but in the heat of combat, they often cast aside weapons in favor of their rending claws. An ice troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 900 pounds. Because of their greater intellects, ice trolls sometimes work as mercenaries, and often serve as soldiers in monstrous armies. They frequently ally with frost giants, and may even be found among northern barbarian tribes, as long as they are well fed and well paid. Ice trolls enjoy the taste of human flesh, and those not working with humans frequently set traps near civilized areas to catch their favorite prey. They will also raid isolated settlements for food, often bringing captured humans back to their icy lairs, where the unfortunate victims are caged and fattened up before finally being devoured by the voracious trolls. In combat, ice trolls are more cautious than normal trolls. They do not normally rush headlong into battle, instead focusing on weaker foes or those bearing fire. They do not hesitate to attack opponents armed with fire, but work together to defeat such enemies before they can bring their dangerous weapons to bear. Ice troll society is more patriarchal than normal troll society, and while males may form gangs to hunt or raid, most ice trolls live in small family groups comprised of a male, a female, and their offspring.</p>",

A Survival success reveals that a nasty blizzard is on its way and that it would be much preferable to depart the next morning. If the PCs ask specific directions to mines to one of the kids who has been up there recently, the players get a +4 circumstance bonus on all skill checks to go the mines. The PCs can also ask adult villagers for directions to the mines but these are quite vague (as they have not make the trip in recent years) and only grant a +2 circumstance bonus on skill checks. If they talk to any villager about going to the mines (adult or otherwise), they are told that a blizzard is coming and they would better wait it out.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The path to the mines is even steeper than the climb from the valley to Horntop and presents two challenges that the PCs need to overcome. First, about an hour&rsquo;s out of Horntop, the path dangerously narrows to a ledge about 20cm wide, with the mountain wall on the left and a sharp drop on the right. Crossing the ledge requires a DC 10 Acrobatics check (DC 15 in a blizzard) or fall and take 3d6 damage (DC 15 Reflex save avoids). After crossing the ledge, the path snakes up for about half an hour and arrives at a large snowy plateau with the opening of the mines visible in the distance. The snow and ice are covering up some dangerous pits than the PCs will need to spot to avoid falling in (treat this encounter as a Pit Trap for the purposes of trap finding abilities). Ask the PCs if they have a marching order. If yes, the character in front needs to succeed at a DC 25 Perception or fall in (DC 20 Reflex save avoids) and take 3d6 points of nonlethal damage (a thick layer of snow cushions the fall). Unfortunately for the poor PC who falls in the pit, a dangerous undead called a Glacial Haunt lies at the bottom and immediately attacks!</span></p>"

The villagers indicated that the attacks all occur at the same location: a flat plains about 30 minutes by foot outside the village where yaks and mountain goats are left grazing. If the players attempt to look for tracks of previous attacks, they will need to succeed a <strong>DC 15 Survival check to find evidence of the Troll&rsquo;s passage</strong> (broken branches and footsteps in the mud). Succeeding this first Survival check grants the PCs another <strong>DC 20 Knowledge Nature check to try to identify the creature</strong> as an Ice Troll. <strong>Successfully tracking the beast back to its lair at this point is very difficult</strong> (recent snows have cleared most tracks) and <strong>requires a DC 25 Survival check</strong>. If the PC&rsquo;s wait for the creature to attack, it will do so within 1d3 days.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Waiting for the beast in the cold and icy winds is physically challenging. If the players have not equipped themselves in appropriate winter gear or do not have access to relevant spells or abilities such as Endure Elements or immunity to cold, they suffer the following consequences. <strong>Each unprotected PC must make a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage</strong>. A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Survival check receives a +4 bonus on this saving throw and may grant this bonus to one of her allies for every 1 point that her check exceeds 15. A character who takes any nonlethal damage from cold or exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as fatigued). These penalties end when the character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from the cold and exposure (source: Pathfinder Core Rulebook - Environmental Rules).</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Battling the Ice Trolls (CR 6, 2400xp)</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Creatures. </span>When the players ambush the Troll, they can attempt to kill it there and then but it will attempt to flee.

Cornered, the Trolls will fight to the death, unless spoken to in Giant and succeeding at a DC 20 diplomacy check. The Troll&rsquo;s lair is a dark natural cave system reaching about 100 feet into the mountain. The first 30 feet next to the cavern entrance are illuminated in dim-light, while the remainder of the cavern is completely dark.

He assures the PCs that he finds yak meat disgusting and would happily go back his underground home, if only they could dispatch the evil wizard that chased him away and slaughtered his kin.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">Treasure.</span> If the players kill the Trolls, they find the cave littered in yak and mountain goat bones.

The statuette looks extremely ancient and does not represent any familiar deity. A DC 20 Knowledge Religion reveals that it represents a Demon Lord of the Underground. If the players make the connection with the satchel that Farkas has gifted them earlier, confirm to them that both satchels look indeed quite similar.</p>"

The result is a glacial haunt, the utter bane of the unwary traveler, for the glacial haunt is drawn to the heat of all sources, be it from magic, fires, or the warmth given off by living creatures. Glacial haunts spend most of their time wandering their frigid domains seeking to kill and devour anything they encounter. When winter spreads her icy embrace to other lands, the glacial haunt's hunting grounds increase. A glacial haunt is 6 feet tall and weighs about 165 pounds. It is usually dressed in the attire it wore at the time of its death, though much of it has rotted or fallen away. Glacial haunts seem to understand, and possibly be able to speak, the Common tongue, but no encounters with these creatures has born any hard evidence of this. Multiple glacial haunts in a single encounter is rare and believed to come about when a group of adventurers succumb to the cold and perish together. Others have speculated that glacial haunts actually reproduce by melting and then splitting into two identical creatures. Glacial haunts detest living creatures and attack them on sight. A favored tactic of glacial haunts is to burrow into the snow when it detects living creatures in its domain, and then spring from ambush to assault them when they move near. Glacial haunts batter their foes with their fists, seeking to destroy them by literally smashing the life from them.</p>",

If any character touches the elevator, Jacod is immediately made aware of the intrusion.

While the ooze cannot easily climb walls or swim, its habit of lurking in the thick mud that lines the banks of marsh pools or lying in harmless-looking pools on dull-colored dungeon floors makes it dangerously easy to overlook and step on.</p><p>Some sages believe that the gray ooze is the result of a failed alchemical experiment, while others postulate that the first gray oozes spontaneously arose from a cesspit of magical detritus. Of course, these theories that gray oozes are not living organisms, but rather the alchemical result of an unfortunate mixture of rare caustic fluids and magical waste, are derided by many who dwell in areas plagued by the creatures but which do not have a long history of magical pollution.</p><p><b>Variant Gray Oozes</b><br> The gray ooze adapts readily and swiftly to changes in environments, the simple structure of its primeval form and its method of using fission to reproduce all but ensuring that such changes occur. Listed below are two such variants that adventurers have encountered.</p><p><b>Crystal Ooze (CR 4):</b> The crystal ooze is an aquatic variant that dwells in deeper waters than most commonly found in the gray ooze's beloved swamps. A crystal ooze has the aquatic subtype and a swim speed of 30 ft. The crystal ooze lacks the gray ooze's constrict ability, but it does secrete a paralytic toxin that causes those whom it strikes to become paralyzed for 3d6 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw (the save DC is Constitution-based).</p><p><b>Id Ooze (CR 6):</b> Perhaps the strangest variant gray oozes are those that have developed a rudimentary intelligence, including the ability to communicate telepathically with other oozes, or even the ability to blast enemies with pulses of raw mental power. Id oozes are advanced gray oozes with an Intelligence score of 2 (and thus gain skill ranks and feats-typically 4 ranks in Stealth, Improved Initiative, and Toughness), can communicate basic empathic information with other id oozes within 100 feet via telepathy, and can use lesser confusion at will as a spell-like ability (CL equals the id ooze's HD).</p>",

While most skeletons are mindless automatons, they still possess an evil cunning imparted to them by their animating force-a cunning that allows them to wield weapons and wear armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating a Skeleton</strong><br /> \"Skeleton\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature).</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Depends on Hit Dice, as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr><th>HD</th><th>CR</th><th>XP</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1/2</td>\n<td>1/6</td>\n<td>65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/3</td>\n<td>135</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>600</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6-7</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8-9</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10-11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1,600</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12-14</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>2,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15-17</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>3,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18-20</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>4,800</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Always neutral evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor bonus changes as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr><th>Skeleton Size</th><th>Natural Armor Bonus</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny or smaller</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium or Large</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> A skeleton drops any HD gained from class levels and changes racial HD to d8s. Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they have 1 racial HD. If the creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can't be made into a skeleton by the animate dead spell. A skeleton uses its Cha modifier (instead of its Con modifier) to determine bonus hit points.</p>\n<p><strong>Saves:</strong> Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A skeleton loses the base creature's defensive abilities and gains DR 5/bludgeoning and immunity to cold. It also gains all of the standard immunities and traits possessed by undead creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> A winged skeleton can't use its wings to fly. If the base creature flew magically, so can the skeleton. All other movement types are retained.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> A skeleton retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that can't work without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw attacks at its full attack bonus. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton's size (see pages 301-302). If the base creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use the skeleton claw damage only if it's better.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A skeleton retains none of the base creature's special attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> A skeleton's Dexterity increases by +2. It has no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores change to 10.</p>\n<p><strong>BAB:</strong> A skeleton's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> A skeleton loses all skill ranks possessed by the base creature and gains none of its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats:</strong> A skeleton loses all feats possessed by the base creature and gains Improved Initiative as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Special Qualities:</strong></strong> A skeleton loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Any, usually the same as base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Organization:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> Generally none, although sometimes a skeleton's creator arms it with magical armor or weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Variant Skeletons</strong><br /> Numerous variant skeletons exist, such as those whose bones burn with an unending fire and those who drip with gore and reassemble themselves over time. Both of these variant skeletons can be created using animate dead, but they count as twice their normal number of Hit Dice per casting. Once controlled, they count normally against the controller's limit.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most dangerous variant skeleton, though, is the skeletal champion. This skeleton retains its intellect, and often any class levels it possessed in life. A skeletal champion cannot be created with animate dead-these potent undead only arise under rare conditions similar to those that cause the manifestation of ghosts or via rare and highly evil rituals.</p>\n<p>Each of the following skeleton types modifies the base skeleton in a few key ways. Except as noted, these variations can be stacked with one another-it's possible to have a bloody burning skeletal champion.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloody Skeleton</strong><br /> A bloody skeleton is coated in a slick layer of blood and gore infused with negative energy. This gore allows the skeleton to reform and heal itself. In addition to the changes for the skeleton template, make the following adjustments to the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> As a normal skeleton + 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast Healing:</strong> A bloody skeleton has fast healing equal to 1 per 2 Hit Dice it possesses (minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Saves:</strong> A bloody skeleton gains channel resistance +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> A bloody skeleton's Charisma is 14.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A bloody skeleton gains the deathless special quality.</p>\n<p><em>Deathless (Su):</em> A bloody skeleton is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but it returns to unlife 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing thereafter to resume healing it. A bloody skeleton can be permanently destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its remains are sprinkled with a vial of holy water.</p>\n<p><strong>Burning Skeleton</strong><br /> A burning skeleton is surrounded by an aura of flames that deals fire damage to those it strikes. In addition to the changes for the skeleton template, make the following adjustments to the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> As a normal skeleton + 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Aura:</strong> Burning skeletons possess a fiery aura.</p>\n<p><em>Fiery Aura (Ex):</em> Creatures adjacent to a burning skeleton take 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of their turn.</p>\n<p>Anyone striking a burning skeleton with an unarmed strike or natural attack takes 1d6 points of fire damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> Burning skeletons lose their immunity to cold but gain immunity to fire. A burning skeleton gains vulnerability to cold damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee Attacks:</strong> A burning skeleton's melee attacks (including both those made with a natural weapon and those made with a manufactured weapon) deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> A burning skeleton's Charisma is 12.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A burning skeleton gains fiery death.</p>\n<p><em>Fiery Death (Su):</em> A burning skeleton explodes into a burst of flame when it dies. Anyone adjacent to the skeleton when it is destroyed takes 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 Hit Dice the skeleton possessed (minimum 1d6). A Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skeleton's Hit Dice + the skeleton's Cha bonus) halves this damage.</p>",

A huge faceless idol made of stone is seated next to the western wall, and is covered in thick white cobwebs. The offering ritual takes only a couple of minutes with blood spraying everywhere but leaving the victim alive. Finally, a huge ogre spider descends from the ceiling on thick silken threads and devours the offered meal. Along the western wall to the idol&rsquo;s feet lies a treasure hoard of various precious objects and magic items. The encounter is composed of four Morlocks and an Ogre Spider. Depending on your party&rsquo;s APL, this can be a very dangerous encounter if the PCs fight all monsters at once. It is quite easy to avoid fighting both the Morlocks and the Ogre Spider at the same time, as the spider will only attack if it is threatened or if a PC comes within 5 feet of the idol.</span></span></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</h2>"

Endless layers of filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some to believe that the creature inside is smaller still. Usually encountered in groups, dark creepers flee from bright light, but are quite brave in the dark.</p><p>Dark creepers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. Their flesh is pale and moist, and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they never take off their clothing-instead piling on new layers when the outermost one grows too ragged.</p><p>For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers can cause, this is nothing compared to the dangers a tribe led by the taller, even more sinister dark stalkers represents. Dark creepers treat their tall, lithe masters almost like gods, presenting them with offerings and obeying their every whim.</p><p>Invariably, several dark stalkers serve as leaders to dark creeper tribes, with all of the tribe's heavy work and labor falling on the diminutive shoulders of the creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their own decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent imbalance in this arrangement- to a dark creeper, a life in the servitude of a dark stalker is a life fulfilled.<b></b></p><p>Dark Creeper Society</p><p> It is known that subterranean cities of dark creepers exist. Most creatures that have seen these cities venture no closer than necessary, for the route to the city is often lined with traps, snares, and other deadly devices to detour would-be trespassers. Each city is a large circular pit with a spiraling staircase leading down to the multi-layered city. A dark creeper city is constantly shrouded in a cloud of impenetrable <i>darkness</i>. The actual habitat and details of dark creeper society remain a mystery, as those that have ventured into a dark creeper city have yet to return and tell of their exploits. It is believed that the race known as dark stalkers are the leaders of such cities.</p><p><br><b>Dark Creeper Characters</b><br> Dark creepers possess racial Hit Dice and may have class levels.

He politely inquires what they are doing in the mines but does not confront them. Players who suspect that he&rsquo;s lying can make a DC 18 Sense Motive check to realize that he&rsquo;s actually furious at the PCs. &nbsp;If the PCs ask him what he&rsquo;s doing down here, he tells them that after the teenager&rsquo;s death he investigated the area and found this faboulous city. He pretends not to know more. He tells the PCs that he suspects that there is a passage to the Underworld here. Farkas will pretend to invite the PCs to join him in his expedition. If the PCs accept, he lets them go in front and leads them in the tunnels ahead where a band of Murlocks are busy excavating. Finally, he waits to strike at the best opportunity starting combat with a destructive spell. In this last showdown, Farkas shouts to the Morlocks to come to his aid.</span></span></p>"
